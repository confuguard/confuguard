gem,aws-graph,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [aws]

Explanation: The package name 'aws-graph' is a minor modification of 'aws', which could confuse users, making it an adversarial name. It has a distinct purpose related to AWS security, differentiating it from the general AWS library. The maintainers are known in the community, which reduces suspicion, but the name still raises concerns due to its similarity to 'aws'.",,,aws

gem,sbuild,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [build]

Explanation: The package name 'sbuild' is very similar to 'build', with only an additional 's' at the beginning, which could easily confuse users. The description of 'sbuild' is also quite generic and does not clearly differentiate its purpose from 'build'. The maintainer 'cantenesse' is not a widely recognized name in the Ruby community, adding to the suspicion. There is no indication that 'sbuild' is a fork or has a distinct purpose from 'build'.",,,build
gem,tushare,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [yashare]

Explanation: The package names 'tushare' and 'yashare' have an edit distance of 2, making them very similar in appearance, likely enough to cause confusion among users. Analyzing the name in isolation suggests an adversarial or deceptive intent (is_adversarial_name is true), even though the package maintainer information appears legitimate and the underlying purposes are distinct (Tushare-Ruby focuses on crawling historical China stocks data while Yashare deals with Yandex Share buttons). There is no indication that 'tushare' is a fork or for testing purposes. However, the close similarity in naming along with the intentional mimicry in spelling creates a suspicious situation (has_suspicious_intent is true), so we do not mark it as an obvious non-typosquat. Risk level: High).",,,yashare
gem,webspec,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [respec]

Explanation: The package name 'webspec' is very similar to 'respec' with a low edit distance of 2 and uses a name that could deceive users by mimicking the legitimate package. Despite having maintainers known in the community, the similarity in name and the closely related description ('Report rspec results to webspec' vs. 'Rerun failing RSpec examples easily.') suggest adversarial intent rather than an obvious fork. There is no evidence of a distinct purpose or obvious test package intent, and the naming does not include a username that would indicate a fork. Based on just the name similarity and metadata, this package appears to be a typosquat with suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,respec

Explanation: The package name 'xf' is similar to 'u2f' but does not have a clear indication of being a fork. The names are close enough to potentially deceive users, making it an adversarial name. The purposes of the packages are distinct, with 'xf' focusing on Enumerable collections and 'u2f' on U2F device handling.

Explanation: The package names 'github.com/jaerk/kernal' and 'github.com/jacrk/kernal' are very similar, differing by only one character, which is a common pattern in typosquatting. There is no description provided for either package, making it difficult to determine distinct purposes or intentions.

Explanation: The package 'io.keploy:api' has no description and no known maintainers, making it difficult to determine its purpose or legitimacy. The namespace 'io.keploy' does not clearly indicate a known organization or user, and the lack of description makes it suspicious.

maven,elasticsearch,org.elasticsearch,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.testcontainers:elasticsearch]

Explanation: Both packages share the same artifact name ('elasticsearch') but belong to different namespaces. Although the edit distance (12) is somewhat high, the difference is solely in the namespace. The org.elasticsearch namespace is a well‐known term and using it in a package whose description ('Elasticsearch subproject :server') starkly differs from the legitimate container management testing purpose of org.testcontainers:elasticsearch can easily confuse users. Furthermore, the absence of any known maintainers in the suspicious package increases its likelihood of being an adversarial attempt. In this case, the similarity in the artifact id combined with the namespace confusion leads to adversarial naming with potential malicious intent.

maven,groovy-astbuilder,org.apache.groovy,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-astbuilder]

Explanation: The package names are very similar aside from the organization prefix, with an edit distance of 7, indicating only minor modifications. The change from 'org.codehaus.groovy' to 'org.apache.groovy' mimics a known reputable organization and could potentially deceive users, despite the professional appearance of the namespace. The identical artifact name 'groovy-astbuilder' and highly similar descriptions further suggest an intentional imitation rather than a legitimate fork. With no known maintainers associated with the 'org.apache.groovy' package, the similarities in metadata and naming conventions imply suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-astbuilder
maven,groovy-cli-commons,org.apache.groovy,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-cli-commons]

Explanation: The package 'org.apache.groovy:groovy-cli-commons' is very similar to 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-cli-commons' with only a difference in the organizational namespace. The minor differences, including the edit distance and the use of a familiar organizational prefix that mimics a legitimate project, indicate it could deceive users. This similarity, along with nearly identical descriptions and the fact that there are no known maintainers for the Apache version, makes it likely that the package is an intentional fork that could be used deceptively. Therefore, it is not obviously a non-typosquat. Risk level: High).",,,org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-cli-commons
maven,groovy-jaxb,org.apache.groovy,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-jaxb]

Explanation: The package 'org.apache.groovy:groovy-jaxb' replaces the legitimate namespace 'org.codehaus.groovy' with 'org.apache.groovy', a known organizational name, which makes the package name confusingly similar to the legitimate one. The edit distance and similarity in description strongly indicate that this is an intentional mimic—likely a fork attempting to leverage the reputation of the legitimate package—thus exhibiting suspicious intent despite lack of known maintainers. Risk level: High).",,,org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-jaxb
maven,hive-exec,org.apache.hive,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.spark-project.hive:hive-exec]

Explanation: The package name 'org.apache.hive:hive-exec' is highly similar to 'org.spark-project.hive:hive-exec' with an edit distance of 10 and employs a namespace ('org.apache.hive') that mimics a well-known organization. The similarity in the names and identical descriptions (which are used by the legitimate Apache community) creates a high potential for confusion. Since the namespace is designed to look like a recognized organization and there are no legitimate maintainers associated with 'org.apache.hive:hive-exec', it is classified as an adversarial name with suspicious intent and is identified as an obvious fork rather than having a distinct purpose or being for testing.

Explanation: The package 'com.github.antonsjava:jaul' has a namespace that closely mimics 'io.github.antonsjava:jaul', with only a minor change from 'io' to 'com'. The descriptions are identical, and there are no known maintainers, making it likely a typosquat.",,,io.github.antonsjava:jaul
maven,javax.annotation,org.netbeans.external,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [org.glassfish:javax.annotation]

Explanation: Although the artifact id 'javax.annotation' is identical between the packages, the namespace 'org.netbeans.external' differs significantly from 'org.glassfish'. The high edit distance and distinct organizational prefixes suggest that the package is not using a minor character change to mimic the legitimate package. However, the fact that it appears to be a fork—as indicated by its different namespace and vague description – and the absence of known maintainers raise concerns about its intent. Thus, while it is not an adversarial name based solely on the package name transformation, its overall presentation (fork with vague purpose) and sparse metadata result in suspicion regarding its intent.

Explanation: The package name 'ab-hooks' is very similar to 'ahooks' (edit distance of 2) with a minor delimiter addition that could mislead users. The minimal README ('# ab-hooks') and lack of clear distinct purpose indicate that it is positioning itself as a fork of the legitimate 'ahooks', without clear organizational backing, and the modified name is adversarial.

npm,adminlte4,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [admin-lte]

Explanation: The package 'adminlte4' closely resembles 'admin-lte' with a minor change in the name, which could confuse users. The description suggests it is related to AdminLTE v4, but it is not clear if it is an official update or fork. The maintainer 'marlonluan' is not a widely recognized maintainer in the npm community, increasing suspicion. The lack of a clear distinction in purpose or namespace further suggests it could be a typosquat.",,,admin-lte
npm,advertonads-ui-core,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@keystone-ui/core]

Explanation: The package 'advertonads-ui-core' shares a significant similarity with '@keystone-ui/core' specifically by adopting the “-ui-core” suffix, which can confuse users despite the higher overall edit distance of 9. Its namespace (or lack thereof) is different, but the similarity in the suffix and the minimal README data (""# adv-ui-core"") raise suspicion. Also, the maintainers list only includes 'advertonads', which does not match the known organizational affiliation behind '@keystone-ui/core'. The structure and naming pattern indicate it is likely an intentional fork designed to mimic the legitimate package, thus leading to adversarial naming and suspicious intent. As such, the package is flagged under typosquatting criteria. Risk level: High).",,,@keystone-ui/core

npm,ai-agent-client,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@fal-ai/client]

Explanation: The package name 'ai-agent-client' is highly similar to '@fal-ai/client' with a low modification (edit distance of 8) and exhibits signs of scope confusion, as it drops the '@' scope and reorders components in the name. Furthermore, the absence of README data combined with a suspicious release metadata increases the likelihood of it being an intentional mimic and a fork. The maintainers list does not appear to match the known maintainers of the legitimate package, which further raises suspicions.

Explanation: The package name 'alidurl' is very similar to 'valid-url' with a minor character alteration (edit distance of 2), making it an intentional mimic. Based solely on the package name, it qualifies as an adversarial name. The naming similarity and metadata mimic suggest that 'alidurl' is a fork of 'valid-url', and it does not have an obviously distinct purpose.

Explanation: The package name 'angular-calendar-guiddle' is a minor variation of the legitimate package 'angular-calendar' achieved by adding a suffix. Despite an edit distance of 8, the naming pattern (suffix augmentation) is one method used to mimic and confuse users. In addition, the descriptions are nearly identical, suggesting no distinct purpose. The only maintainer, 'kaleu50', does not appear to be a known maintainer, raising further concerns.

npm,anteros-react,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [react]

Explanation: The package name 'anteros-react' uses prefix augmentation with 'anteros-' added to 'react', which fits common typosquatting strategies. Despite the edit distance being 8, the name leverages compound squatting tactics that could potentially mislead users by mimicking 'react'. Its description does not clearly differentiate its purpose from React and appears to be a fork rather than a distinct utility. Additionally, the use of a single maintainer ('edsonmartins') without strong community backing further supports the potential for typosquatting. Risk level: High).",,,react

Explanation: The package name 'ascendex-test' uses a prefix (ascendex-) added to the legitimate package name 'test', which is a common method of compound squatting. Despite the relatively high edit distance of 9, the use of an organizational prefix and similarity to 'test' can easily confuse users. The name appears to be a fork (as indicated by the naming convention) that likely mimics the legitimate package but without clear distinct purposes – both reference testing.

Furthermore, the description in '@paladen/auth' is vague and mentions errors rather than defining a clear or distinct purpose compared to the legitimate 'auth' package, and the inclusion of a user scope (instead of a trusted organizational name) further supports the possibility of it being an intentional fork designed to capitalize on the reputation of Auth.js.

Explanation: Although the legitimate package 'aws-cdk' is unscoped, the suspicious package '@packyak/aws-cdk' uses a namespace to prepend the well‐known package name, which can be misleading. The edit distance is high if measured across the whole name, but the deliberate attachment of 'aws-cdk' to the scoped name indicates potential intent to impersonate or confuse users. Furthermore, the description of @packyak/aws-cdk describes a distinct framework with a different purpose from the official AWS CDK Toolkit. Its namespace reflects an organizational or user scope, and the maintainer is a known npm contributor, which could argue against a straightforward fork. Nonetheless, the decision is driven solely by the naming similarity and confusion potential, hence it is flagged as having an adversarial name and suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,aws-cdk

Explanation: Although the '@webiny' namespace appears to be a valid organizational scope with known maintainers, the package name '@webiny/aws-sdk' effectively appends the well‐known 'aws-sdk' to its scope. This naming strategy, combined with an edit distance that suggests purposeful mimicry and a very succinct description ('Wrapper for AWS SDK'), indicates that the package could potentially deceive users into thinking it is the original or a direct variant of 'aws-sdk'. The use of the legitimate package’s name in a different scope creates scope confusion and resembles adversarial naming patterns, which makes it likely a fork engineered for deceptive purposes.

This mimicry, combined with a suspicious description ('security holding package') that hints at malicious intent, raises red flags. The namespace difference (no scope for bitfinex-dev compared to '@formkit' for the legitimate package) further contributes to potential scope confusion.

Explanation: The package name 'bitfinex-test' is formed by adding the 'bitfinex-' prefix to the legitimate package name 'test', which qualifies as a prefix augmentation—a common adversarial naming technique. Given the edit distance and the fact that the legitimate package 'test' is well-known and used for Node.js testing, this adds confusion. Moreover, the description for 'bitfinex-test' is minimal and includes terms like 'security holding package', which raises suspicions of deceptive intent, indicating potential typosquatting.

The edit distance of 5 supports the possibility of intentional mimicry. Additionally, the package description 'security holding package' raises suspicion compared to the detailed and purpose-driven description of the legitimate 'mqlight-dev'.

Despite an edit distance of 8, the resemblance in structure, combined with the security holding package description, raises suspicions. There are no known maintainers, and the change in namespace from '@matter' to an unscoped name further supports potential adversarial intent.

Explanation: The package name 'bitmart-dev' is quite similar to '@formkit/dev' despite an edit distance of 7, suggesting potential intentional mimicry. The use of a non-affiliated namespace (bitmart instead of formkit) appears to be a deliberate attempt to confuse users, qualifying it as an adversarial name. The naming pattern also indicates it is a fork (or a mimic) of the legitimate package, without indication of providing distinct functionalities. In addition, the package description simply says 'security holding package' along with a minimal README, indicating potentially suspicious intent. With no known maintainers and lack of detailed documentation, the overall evidence leans towards a typosquat attempt rather than a legitimate derivative.

Explanation: The package name 'bitmart-test' employs a prefix addition ('bitmart-') to the legitimate 'test', which is a common tactic in typosquatting via prefix/suffix augmentation. The edit distance of 8 further suggests the names are intended to be confusingly similar despite the additional characters. The description 'security holding package' in bitmart-test raises additional suspicion as it appears to be a placeholder often used in malicious intent deployments. Moreover, there are no known maintainers provided for bitmart-test, and while the name might suggest testing functionality, it does not align with the detailed, well-supported purpose of the legitimate 'test' package. These factors collectively indicate that 'bitmart-test' is suspicious with adversarial intent rather than legitimately being a fork or an offering with a distinct purpose.

Based solely on the name, it appears adversarial as it uses a simple substitution ('blue' vs 'vue') that could confuse users. The metadata indicates that 'blue-jest' is essentially a fork of the legitimate 'vue-jest' because it serves the same function (Jest configuration for Vue) without any distinctive differences in purpose. The package is also designed for testing (as indicated by its description) and its readme is nearly identical.

Explanation: The package name 'bun-css-loader' is a near mirror of the legitimate 'css-loader' with the addition of the 'bun-' prefix. This form of prefix augmentation meets criteria for an adversarial name based solely on package name similarity. Its description shows functionality similar to 'css-loader', but it does not explicitly declare itself as a fork or show a distinct purpose. Additionally, the maintainer listed ('bytenote') is different from the legitimate package's team, which raises concerns.

Explanation: The package name 'carone-react' is extremely similar to 'carbon-react' via a minor substitution ('b' vs 'one'), which fits adversarial tactics like minor character alterations designed to mislead users. The descriptions of the two packages indicate they serve the same basic purpose (a React component library) and no clear indication is given that carone-react is an official fork or has a distinct purpose. Furthermore, the maintainers of carone-react (['emilecar']) do not match the well-known community or organizational maintainers behind carbon-react.

Explanation: The package name 'cesiumjs' is very similar to 'cesium' due to the addition of the 'js' suffix, which is a common compound squatting tactic and can deceive users. Although the descriptions for both packages are nearly identical, the maintainers for 'cesiumjs' do not match the official CesiumGS team, raising further suspicion. There is no indication that 'cesiumjs' is an official fork or has a distinct purpose compared to 'cesium'.

Explanation: The package name 'cfl-cli' is very similar to the legitimate 'cpy-cli' (edit distance 2), making it potentially confusing for users and thus adversarial. The name similarity suggests an intentional mimic, and the similarity is indicative of a fork rather than a distinct project. Additionally, the lack of README data along with its use as a potential test package reinforces a lack of distinctive purpose.

Explanation: Both packages share the same base name and nearly identical functionality. The only difference is the addition of the '@omgduke' scope, which is a minor modification that could be used to mimic the official package. There is no evidence that the scoped package is explicitly marked as a fork, nor does it have a distinct purpose or serve testing functions. Additionally, while the maintainer is identified as 'omgduke', the similarity in naming is potentially adversarial and deceptive.

Explanation: The name 'circle' is very similar to 'cycle' (only one character difference) and could easily deceive users. The lack of a README in 'circle' raises further concerns, and there is no evidence to indicate it is a fork or intended for testing. The maintained identity ('case') does not strongly tie it to the legitimate package's community.

npm,cli,@coat,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [cli]

Explanation: The package '@coat/cli' uses a namespace combined with 'cli' that closely mirrors the legitimate package name 'cli'. Although its edit distance is 6, the addition of a namespace may confuse users by implying an association or fork of the original package. The provided description is extremely minimal (a placeholder with 'TODO') and lacks the detailed, helpful information found in the official 'cli' package, suggesting it may be intentionally mimicking 'cli'. The use of a namespace that does not clearly belong to the original author, along with the minimal README and metadata, indicates a likely adversarial intent. With the available information, '@coat/cli' appears to be an obvious fork that does not provide a distinct purpose, further reinforcing the suspicion. Risk level: High).",,,cli

npm,cli,@ltf-cli,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [cli]

Explanation: The package name '@ltf-cli/cli' uses a prefixed namespace that modifies the legitimate 'cli' package name in a way that is likely to confuse users. The inclusion of 'cli' in both names coupled with the namespace alteration indicates an adversarial name. There is no clear indication that it is a fork (no fork-specific naming or description), nor that it serves a distinct purpose.

npm,cli,@maegi,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [@mazui/cli]

Explanation: The package name @maegi/cli is extremely similar to @mazui/cli (with an edit distance of 2), making it likely to be mistaken for the legitimate one. The minor differences in the namespace suggest an intentional mimic rather than a distinct fork, especially since there is no added identifier indicating a username-based fork. Additionally, the missing README data increases the suspicion. The metadata does not indicate a separate purpose or testing nature, and with an unfamiliar maintainer ('werehamster') not clearly connected to the legitimate package, the overall evidence points towards a potential typosquat with adversarial intent.

npm,cli,@stedi,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [cli]

Explanation: @stedi/cli is an adversarial name as it uses a namespace that could confuse users into thinking it is related to the legitimate 'cli' package. The purpose of @stedi/cli is distinct as it specifically enables interaction with Stedi's APIs, which is different from the general command line toolkit provided by 'cli'.

Explanation: The package name 'cli-ator' is formed by adding a suffix to the legitimate 'cli' package, which can be confusing to users and falls under adversarial naming tactics.

Explanation: The package 'crack-ux' shares the common suffix 'ux' with the legitimate '@sumor/ux', but the remainder of its name is substantially altered – with an edit distance of 7 it does not represent a trivial typo. However, its choice of the term 'crack' appears purposefully provocative and stands in semantic contrast to 'sumor', suggesting an adversarial attempt at mimicking or capitalizing on the reputable package. There is no namespace indicating it is a fork (nor is any username present to suggest a legitimate fork), and its lack of README data reinforces suspicions despite having a known maintainer.

Explanation: The computed edit distance of 8 suggests that the names are not minimally different; however, considering the transformation from mqlight-dev to deepcoin-dev, it appears as an intentional mimic. The naming pattern (replacing 'mqlight' with 'deepcoin') can confuse users given its similarity, fitting adversarial transformation criteria. There is no indication that deepcoin-dev has been developed by known maintainers (empty list) and its description marks it as a security holding package, which is typically a red flag. Additionally, the package does not show distinct functionality from mqlight-dev, instead it appears to be presented as a fork. Overall, the naming and metadata imply deceptive intent.

Explanation: The package name 'deep-merge-js' is very similar to 'deepmerge-ts' (edit distance of 2) and exhibits clear signs of mimicry: a delimiter difference and a suffix change from '-ts' to '-js'. Such modifications are classic adversarial naming techniques. In addition, based solely on the package name, it appears to be a fork of the legitimate package. There is no evidence that 'deep-merge-js' offers a distinct purpose — both packages aim at deep merging objects — and its maintainer ('smiranton.ua') is different from that of 'deepmerge-ts'.

npm,deps,@fishx,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [module-deps]

Explanation: The package name '@fishx/deps' shares only the common substring 'deps' with the legitimate 'module-deps', and the inclusion of a namespace (@fishx) that is not a trivial variation of the legitimate unscoped name points more toward a fork rather than an intentional mimic of the legitimate package. However, the package description of '@fishx/deps' appears to reference content from a completely different package (@umijs/bundler-webpack), which is highly deceptive and raises significant suspicion. Although the name alone does not seem to be overtly adversarial (not a simple character swap or minor edit), the overall metadata indicates suspicious intent. The package’s maintainers do not align with those of the legitimate package, and its metadata suggests that it is a fork rather than a distinct project with a distinct purpose. Therefore, while the adversarial name flag is false based strictly on the name analysis, the overall attributes (fork status and deceptive description) indicate suspicious intent.

Explanation: The package name 'devio-auth' uses a prefix augmentation ('devio-') to the legitimate 'auth' package name, which can be confusing to users despite an edit distance of 6. It follows a pattern common in typosquatting where a minimal modification is made to a popular package name. The lack of a README further raises suspicion. Additionally, the package does not indicate a distinct purpose or test usage, and the single maintainer ('sr-igor') is not a widely recognized or known maintainer in the ecosystem. These elements together point to adversarial intent rather than an obviously legitimate fork or distinct project. Risk level: High).",,,auth

Its name uses a minimal change (a single version increment) as an adversarial tactic, and the description 'security holding package' raises further suspicion.

Explanation: Although the edit distance between 'dtable-store' and 'store' is relatively high (7), the transformation is achieved by a simple prefix augmentation – a common adversarial tactic. The name change can mislead users into believing it is related to the legitimate 'store' package. In addition, 'dtable-store' appears to be a fork of 'store' given that the maintainer (seafile) does not align with the maintainer of the popular 'store' package.

Explanation: The package name 'easyme' is very similar to 'enzyme' with an edit distance of 2, which makes it likely to confuse users. Based solely on the name similarity, the name is adversarial. Although the metadata does not include explicit fork indicators (such as a username or clear fork reference), the absence of organization or namespace data prevents identifying it as a legitimate fork. The functionalities do not appear to be distinct from 'enzyme', and there is no evidence to suggest it is intended for testing. Moreover, the lack of a proper README and minimal description increases suspicion of deceptive intent.

Explanation: The package name 'echarts-signlog' builds on the legitimate 'echarts' by appending an extra term ('signlog'), which can be seen as a suffix augmentation that may deceive users into thinking it is related or an official fork. The edit distance of 8 combined with the nearly identical description to Apache ECharts, and the unusual maintainer ('pubwell') that does not match the well‐known maintainers of Apache ECharts, point to suspicious intent.

npm,elenemt-plus,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [element-plus]

Explanation: The edit distance of 2 suggests a minor and intentional misspelling intended to mimic 'element-plus'. Based solely on the package name, the change is minor enough to be considered adversarial. Although the package does not include an explicit namespace or username that typically indicates a fork, the guidance indicates that 'elenemt-plus' is obviously a fork of 'element-plus', and its description is nearly identical to that of the legitimate package. The maintainers are not recognized in the community and the overall metadata is suspicious. Therefore, the analysis marks it as a potential typosquat with adversarial intent. Risk level: High).",,,element-plus
npm,email-smtp-transport,@spinajs,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [nodemailer-smtp-transport]

Explanation: The package '@spinajs/email-smtp-transport' has a namespace that does not clearly indicate a known organization or user related to 'nodemailer-smtp-transport'. The description is vague and lacks detail, which is often a red flag. The maintainer 'gben-spina' is not recognized as a known maintainer in the npm community.

npm,enqueue,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [queue]

Explanation: The package name 'enqueue' is very similar to 'queue' with an edit distance of 2, which falls under a prefix augmentation that can deceive users. Although the maintainer is a known contributor (mattmueller) and there is no explicit namespace that suggests an external organization or fork by a third party, the name similarity combined with an almost identical purpose and description makes it suspicious. Besides, the function and description are nearly identical to 'queue', raising the possibility of confusing users regarding its origin. Therefore, while it is not classified as an obvious fork or a test package, its adversarial naming and suspicious intent are significant flags. Risk level: High).",,,queue
npm,enquirer,@atweel,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [enquirer]

Explanation: The package name '@atweel/enquirer' is nearly identical to 'enquirer', differing only by an added namespace. This namespace appears unrelated to the known original maintainers and can cause user confusion. Its metadata and description mirror that of the legitimate package, and there is no indication that it is a fork or a test package. As a result, the name is adversarial, making it suspicious.Package is adversarial and have similar purpose, so it's likely a typosquat.",,,enquirer

Explanation: The package name 'envi-conf' is only minimally different from 'envconf' (edit distance of 2), which falls under common typosquatting tactics like delimiter modification or alternate spelling. There is no additional namespace information that would indicate a legitimate organizational fork; moreover, the absence of any known maintainers raises further suspicion. The description of 'envi-conf' as a 'security holding package' is particularly alarming and suggests malicious intent. Furthermore, the provided point clearly indicates this is presented as a fork of 'envconf', yet it does not offer a distinct new purpose. Taken together, these factors point to a deceptive, typosquat package. Risk level: High).",2025-03-10 18:05:58.084,,envconf
npm,epmsapi,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [npm-api]

Explanation: The package name 'epmsapi' differs from 'npm-api' by a minor character substitution (‘e’ instead of ‘n’) which is a common tactic in typosquatting and adversarial naming. There is no evidence or metadata (such as a fork statement, testing indication, or clear namespace alignment) to suggest it is a genuine fork or a test package. In addition, the lack of a proper README and the use of an obscure maintainer handle further raise suspicions. Based solely on the package name similarity and the sparse metadata, this appears to be an intentional mimic of 'npm-api.'Package is adversarial and have similar purpose, so it's likely a typosquat.",,,npm-api
npm,errorme,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [error-ex]

Explanation: The package name 'errorme' is similar to 'error-ex' with a 1-step Levenshtein distance, indicating it could be an intentional mimic. The purpose of 'errorme' is distinct from 'error-ex', but the similarity in names and the presence of a known maintainer raises suspicion.

Explanation: The package '@types/es-get-iterator' is an intentional mimic of 'es-get-iterator' due to the addition of the '@types/' namespace, which is commonly used for TypeScript type definitions.

Explanation: The package name 'eslint-config-airbe' is very similar to 'eslint-config-airbnb' with an edit distance of 2, making it highly likely to be an intentional mimic. Based solely on the package name, it falls under adversarial name tactics as it uses minor character alteration to potentially confuse users. The package appears to be a fork of the legitimate package since the similarity is so close and there is no indication of a distinct purpose or significant changes. Additionally, while the description provides similar usage details to the legit package, the overall presentation (including the lack of clear differentiation and the presence of a single maintainer who is not recognized as a known maintainer in the community) points toward suspicious intent. Therefore, it is marked as having suspicious intent and is considered an adversarial fork. Risk level: High).",,,eslint-config-airbnb

Explanation: The package name 'eslint-config-b2b' differs by only 2 characters from 'eslint-config-erb', making it highly similar and potentially deceptive. Based solely on the package names, the similarity is sufficient to mislead users, hence it is considered an adversarial name. There is no indication in the name or metadata that it is a fork (no user-specific or organizational indication) and there is no evidence of distinct functionality.

Explanation: The package name 'eslint-config-fritx' is very similar to 'eslint-config-eslint' (edit distance 5) and uses a slight name change that could confuse users, especially considering that CSS eslint configuration packages are recognized by their naming pattern. Despite having a detailed description, the intentional mimicry by substituting 'eslint' with 'fritx' combined with similarities in the metadata points toward adversarial naming. There is no indication that this is an official fork (the maintainer is 'fritx' and not clearly related to the ESLint team), and the purpose is not distinct from that of the legitimate package.

The similarities in both name and description ('The ultimate ESLint shareable config' versus 'ESLint configuration used by Next.js') can easily deceive users.

Explanation: The package name 'eslint-config-zzish' is quite similar to 'eslint-config-eslint' with only a minor modification, which is consistent with common typosquatting techniques. Based solely on the name, it may confuse users due to its close resemblance (minor character substitutions with an edit distance of 5). The naming pattern suggests it is intended to mimic or impersonate the legitimate package. It is also marked as a fork given that the name is a variant of the original, however, its metadata (readme focusing on prerelease publishing) indicates it may be used for testing purposes rather than serving as a fully distinct configuration package. The set of maintainers does not include known or recognized maintainers from the official ESLint team and the description does not provide any clear unique purpose or additional value compared to the official package.

Explanation: The package name 'fameex-test' uses a prefix augmentation on a common package name 'test' and meets several adversarial criteria, even though the edit distance is relatively high. The use of a prefix that could be easily mistaken for an official or related project, coupled with its description 'security holding package', suggests an intent to deceive and mislead users by mimicking the well-known 'test' package. There are no known legitimate maintainers, and instead of serving a distinct purpose, it appears to be a fork intended to confuse. For these reasons, the package should be considered as having suspicious intent and an adversarial name. Risk level: High).",2025-02-26 08:56:59.218,,test
npm,fast-pay-ui,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [material-ui]

Explanation: The package name 'fast-pay-ui' is similar to 'material-ui' but does not have a trivial namespace difference. It has a 1-step Levenshtein distance, making it an adversarial name. The description indicates a distinct purpose related to a specific platform, but the similarity in names could confuse users. The maintainer is known, which adds some legitimacy, but the overall similarity and potential for confusion classify it as suspicious.",,,material-ui
npm,feast-css,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible package confusion of [css]

Explanation: The package name 'feast-css' is created by adding a prefix to the legitimate name 'css', which is a common adversarial tactic. The edit distance is high, but the pattern of prefix augmentation can confuse users. Additionally, its description 'security holding package' is suspicious and very different from the detailed and functional description of the legitimate 'css' package. The maintainers list shows it’s maintained by 'npm', which could indicate a legitimate account; however, the combination of the minimal description and adversarial naming indicates suspicious intent rather than a simple fork.

Explanation: The package 'fe-cookie-consent' is labeled as a 'security holding package', which is often used to prevent typosquatting. The name is similar enough to 'react-cookie-consent' to potentially confuse users, especially since it lacks a distinct namespace or description indicating a different purpose. The maintainer 'npm' suggests it is a placeholder to prevent misuse, but the similarity in name makes it suspicious.

npm,filigran-ui,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@alpinejs/ui]

Explanation: The package name 'filigran-ui' closely mimics the legitimate '@alpinejs/ui' by retaining the '-ui' suffix and using a similar sounding root ('filigran' vs 'alpinejs'). Based solely on the name analysis, the change is minimal enough to confuse users, classifying it as an adversarial name. Its naming pattern also indicates a fork attempt of the original package. There is no indication from the name that it serves a distinct purpose, and there is no evidence that the package is meant for testing. The maintainer's username ('jpkha-filigran') does not match known trusted maintainers for '@alpinejs/ui'. Additionally, the description is minimally descriptive, adding to the suspicious intent. Therefore, the package is marked as a potential typosquat with adversarial intent. Risk level: High).",,,@alpinejs/ui
npm,fill-range,@types,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [fill-range]

Explanation: The package '@types/fill-range' is using the standard @types scope which is typically used for type definitions and therefore represents a fork of the original 'fill-range'. Despite the legitimate purpose of @types packages in the ecosystem, the similar naming with a namespace added in front can still potentially deceive users. The edit distance of 7 and the mimic style (through scope augmentation) indicate an adversarial naming strategy. While the maintainers (['types']) are known in the community and typical for @types packages, the description ([object Object]) is suspiciously non-descriptive and might be interpreted as an attempt to mislead users. Hence, it does not have an obviously distinct purpose and displays several signs of potential deceptive intent. Risk level: High).",,,fill-range

Explanation: The package 'fluid-tooltip' is described as a 'security holding package', which often indicates a placeholder to prevent typosquatting. The name 'fluid-tooltip' is similar to 'float-tooltip', with both names involving a concept of movement or positioning, which could confuse users. There is no indication of a distinct purpose, intentional play on words, or known maintainers, making it likely a typosquat.",,,float-tooltip
npm,flux-sdk-helpers,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@descope/sdk-helpers]

Explanation: The package name 'flux-sdk-helpers' closely mimics the legitimate package '@descope/sdk-helpers' by preserving the common suffix 'sdk-helpers' while substituting only the organization name. Despite an edit distance of 9, the similarity in structure and terminology suggests a deliberate attempt to confuse users, which makes it an adversarial name. There is no indication that 'flux-sdk-helpers' is a fork (it lacks username indication in the name) and both packages serve nearly identical purposes. The maintainers of 'flux-sdk-helpers' are different from those behind '@descope/sdk-helpers', raising further concern.

Explanation: The package name 'formidable-serverless-2' is almost identical to the legitimate 'formidable-serverless' (edit distance 2) with a numeric suffix that matches several potential adversarial naming techniques such as prefix/suffix augmentation. Although the description is nearly identical to the legitimate package, its slight modification in the name can confuse users, and it appears to be an obvious fork rather than a genuinely distinct alternative. The maintainer ('joeroddy') does not clearly tie it to the original organization, and the reuse of description without improvements further increases concerns for typosquat or deceptive intent. Risk level: High).",,,formidable-serverless
npm,forms,@types,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [types]

Explanation: The package '@types/forms' uses a common namespace '@types/' which is typically used for TypeScript type definitions. However, the description is abnormal, and the legitimate package 'types' lacks a README, making it difficult to determine the relationship. The namespace '@types/' is not inherently suspicious, but the lack of clear information and the abnormal description suggest potential typosquatting.",,,types

Explanation: The package 'fs-extended' differs from 'is-extended' by only 1 character, which falls squarely into the category of adversarial name choices. Its naming pattern is clearly mimicking the legitimate package name even though the underlying functionality is different – 'is-extended' is a type-checking utility while 'fs-extended' extends the native file system API. Furthermore, the similarity and obvious name mimicry (combined with it being presented as a fork) create the potential for user confusion. Although the package is maintained by a known maintainer (darsain) and includes a detailed README, the intentional mimicry in the naming coupled with its fork nature raises significant suspicion.

Explanation: @types/function-bind is a scoped package that adds a namespace to the legitimate function-bind package. The '@types/' namespace is commonly used for TypeScript type definitions, which indicates that it is not a direct fork but rather a legitimate usage. However, the similarity in names and the potential for confusion makes it an adversarial name.

npm,function.prototype.name,@types,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [function.prototype.name]

Explanation: The package '@types/function.prototype.name' is an intentional mimic of 'function.prototype.name' due to the addition of the '@types/' namespace, which is common for type definitions in TypeScript. This creates a potential for confusion among users. The names are closely related, and the '@types/' prefix suggests it is a type definition for the legitimate package, which could mislead users. However, it is likely a fork since it is associated with a known namespace for type definitions. The maintainers are legitimate, which reduces suspicion, but the overall context still raises concerns about potential user deception.",,,function.prototype.name
npm,gate-dev,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [save-dev]

Explanation: The package name 'gate-dev' is extremely similar to 'save-dev' (edit distance of 2) and employs minor character modifications that can easily mislead users, making it an adversarial name. Despite the similarity in name indicating it may be a fork, the absence of a README and the mimicry of a security holding package in the legitimate package's metadata raise concerns. Additionally, the listed maintainer does not appear to be a widely recognized or affiliated maintainer, further increasing suspicion despite the possibility of it being an intentional fork.

Explanation: The names 'gawk' and 'gaze' are similar enough that 'gawk' could be seen as an intentional mimic of 'gaze', particularly since they differ by only one character. This creates potential for user confusion. Additionally, both packages serve different purposes, with 'gawk' focusing on observable JavaScript objects and arrays, while 'gaze' is a file watching utility.

Explanation: The package name 'gestalt-docs' is extremely close to 'globals-docs', with only a minor change that could easily deceive users. The name manipulation fits several adversarial techniques (minor character alteration resulting in homographic similarity). There is no evidence in the package metadata or description to suggest it is a dedicated fork or test package, and the maintainer does not appear to be a widely recognized member of the community for globals-docs.

Explanation: @types/get-symbol-description is a scoped package that adds a namespace to the legitimate package get-symbol-description. The '@types/' namespace is commonly used for TypeScript type definitions, which indicates it is not a direct fork but rather a legitimate usage. However, the addition of the namespace could potentially confuse users who are not aware of this convention, making it adversarial.

npm,getui-sdk,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@rss3/sdk]

Explanation: The package name 'getui-sdk' is not very similar to '@rss3/sdk', and the lack of a README suggests it may not have a clear purpose.

The name 'getui-sdk' could potentially confuse users due to its structure, which resembles a legitimate package but does not clearly indicate its purpose or origin.",,,@rss3/sdk
npm,git-cockpit,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [git]

Explanation: The package name 'git-cockpit' is a modification of 'git' that could confuse users, making it an adversarial name.

Explanation: The package name 'gith4ck' bears only a minor change from 'githulk' (an edit distance of 2), replacing the letter 'u' with the digit '4', which is a known tactic to bypass restrictions (e.g., using 4 in place of hack due to NPM restrictions). This makes the name adversarial since it can easily deceive users. Additionally, the provided guidance indicates that 'gith4ck' is to be considered a fork of 'githulk', and its naming and description are purposefully crafted to mimic the legitimate package while introducing suspicious intent. The metadata and description, including the note about modifying the word 'hack', further support the conclusion of deceptive intent. Risk level: High).",,,githulk

Explanation: The package name 'gps2json' differs from 'po2json' by only two characters, making it highly similar and potentially confusing. Although the functionalities differ (one extracts GPS data from images while the other converts PO files to JSON), the minor alteration in name raises concerns of intentional mimicry. Additionally, without evidence of a clear organizational namespace or widely recognized maintainers, the similarity in naming combined with ambiguous intent in the description implies suspicious intent.

Explanation: The names 'gqlgen' and 'gqlmin' are similar enough that 'gqlgen' could be seen as an intentional mimic of 'gqlmin', particularly since they differ by only one character. The description of 'gqlgen' does not indicate it is a fork, and it has a distinct purpose related to command-line interface usage, which is different from the minification purpose of 'gqlmin'.

npm,gummy,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [gamma]

Explanation: The edit distance of 2 and the similarity in the names indicate that 'gummy' is intentionally designed to mimic 'gamma'. The use of a scoped namespace (@lr-run) in 'gummy' when 'gamma' is unscoped further adds to the confusion, making it appear adversarial. The package appears to be a fork (as indicated by the instructions) rather than offering a distinct functionality from 'gamma', and lacks a proper description beyond a minimal README that does not clarify its intent. Additionally, the maintainers of 'gummy' are different from those of 'gamma', and the sparse description heightens suspicions of deceptive intent. Risk level: High).",,,gamma
npm,gummy-cli,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [cli]

Explanation: The name 'gummy-cli' is constructed by prefixing 'gummy-' to the legitimate package name 'cli'. This prefix augmentation is a common typosquatting technique and introduces ambiguity, making it potentially deceptive. Additionally, the package’s lack of a README and absence of known maintainers further raise suspicion. While the package name mimics 'cli' closely, its extra component suggests it is not a legitimately distinct tool but rather an intentional fork aimed at confusing users. Risk level: High).",,,cli

npm,http-i18n,,false_positive,"Possible `asemantic substitution` package confusion of [hexo-i18n]

Explanation: The package name 'http-i18n' is very similar to 'hexo-i18n' with an edit distance of 3, making it likely to confuse users and indicating an intentional mimic. The name transformation (changing 'hexo' to 'http') falls under asemantic substitution/homographic replacement, which qualifies as an adversarial name based solely on the package name. Although it might seem like a fork of the legitimate package at first glance, it does not include a username or clear fork indicator. The purpose of both packages appears similar, and the description of 'http-i18n' is brief and lacks the detailed context provided by 'hexo-i18n', which raises suspicion. Additionally, the maintainers list contains a single name ('orangeman') that does not strongly associate it with the established project, further adding to the suspicion.

Explanation: The package '@alodi/i18n' is derived from 'i18n' by adding a namespace, which constitutes a prefix augmentation. Although the namespace '@alodi' could indicate a legitimate organization or maintainer (and indeed the maintainer 'hoosai' is listed), the modification in form combined with the minimal descriptive change ('lodi i18n' versus the extensive description of the legit package) suggests an intentional mimic aimed at confusing users.

There is no clear indication that 'jsbinpack' is an officially recognized fork (especially given that the name does not include an obvious username or clear fork markers), and its purpose appears nearly identical to that of 'jsonpack'. Although it has a proper README and appears to be developed under a single maintainer not known to be affiliated with the 'jsonpack' project, the minor name change combined with nearly identical metadata exhibits a suspicious intent to mimic the legitimate package.

Although the edit distance is high (9), the similarity in the core package name and the addition of a namespace can confuse users, making the name adversarial. However, because the package name includes a username (@arskang) and the description mirrors the functionality of the legitimate package, this indicates it is effectively a fork rather than a malicious typosquat. There is no indication of a distinct purpose, testing usage, or malicious intent, and while the scope might be interpreted as impersonation, the inclusion of a username helps clarify that it is a fork.

Explanation: The package name 'js-promise-queue' only differs by the prefix ('js' vs 'sb') from 'sb-promise-queue', which could easily confuse users. This one-character semantic substitution aligns with adversarial naming practices. There is no indication that it is a fork, test package, or has a distinct purpose, and having a known maintainer does little to mitigate the similarity that seems designed to mimic the legitimate package.

npm,kexpress-http,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [http]

Explanation: The package name 'kexpress-http' is constructed by adding a prefix ('kexpress-') to the legitimate name 'http', which is a common tactic in compound squatting. With an edit distance of 9, the names share enough similarity to potentially mislead users, and the prefix augmentation is considered adversarial. The naming pattern indicates that this is clearly a fork of the 'http' package rather than having a distinct purpose. Additionally, the lack of README data is noted, but there is no explicit malicious intent or suspicious metadata in the description. The maintainer 'kinuxroot' is not recognized as a known maintainer in this context, however the transformation of the package name itself is enough to flag it as a potential typosquat even if it is intentionally forking the package.

Explanation: The package names share a common '-dev' suffix but differ significantly in their unique identifier parts ('kraken' vs 'mqlight'), resulting in an edit distance of 7. Although the names aren’t similar enough (e.g. a 1-step edit) to be considered adversarial solely based on name similarity, the context and metadata tell a different story. The provided description of kraken-dev is marked as a 'security holding package' and is nearly empty except for that, which is a known red flag for suspicious intent. There is also no known maintainer information, and it appears to have been created clearly as a fork of the legitimate package, mqlight-dev, without offering a distinct purpose or new functionality. Taken together, this indicates that kraken-dev is designed to mimic mqlight-dev intentionally, leaning towards suspicious typosquatting behavior even though the name transformation is not a close, minor modification.

Explanation: The name 'kuqoi-npm' uses a simple prefix augmentation to the legitimate name 'Npm' and thus qualifies as an adversarial name even when considered without the description. The inclusion of the username 'kuqoi' in the package name is an indication (by the provided points) that this package is being presented as a fork. The package does not offer a distinct purpose—its metadata is minimal (a bare 'README:' in the description) in contrast to the detailed, albeit deprecated, description of the original 'Npm'.

Explanation: The package name 'lbank-test' is formed by affixing a prefix ('lbank-') to the legitimate 'test' package name, which is a typical form of adversarial or compound squatting despite an edit distance of 6. This prefix augmentation is designed to deceive users into thinking it is a fork or a related package of the well-known 'test' package, but its association with a 'security holding package' in the description raises concerns for suspicious intent. There is no indication of legitimate maintainers, and while the name includes 'test', the description does not indicate it is for testing purposes.

Explanation: The package name 'levy-cli' is created by simply adding a prefix to the well‐known 'cli' package, a classic prefix augmentation that can confuse users. Although the edit distance is moderately high (5), the pattern of name manipulation is common in typosquatting schemes. Additionally, the purpose described in 'levy-cli' (providing project creation commands for React, Vue, TypeScript etc.) is distinct from the general command line toolkit functionality of 'cli', suggesting it may be a fork or copy with a different focus. The absence of association with known maintainers (the only maintainer is 'qingshanhan') further contributes to the suspicion of a deceptive intent. Thus, solely based on the package naming and metadata, 'levy-cli' is flagged as using an adversarial name with potentially suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,cli

The name alteration is a known typosquatting tactic and appears to intentionally mimic the Auth.js CLI tool. Additionally, the description of 'lincd-auth' is minimal (‘README:’) compared to the detailed documentation of 'auth', and its maintainers do not match those of the legitimate package.

Explanation: The package '@cfware/lint' is nearly identical in name to the legitimate 'lint', differing only by the addition of a namespace which could confuse users through scope confusion. The transformation of the package name qualifies as an adversarial name because it uses a prefix that may be interpreted as an affiliation or fork of the original. Additionally, the package appears to be a fork of 'lint', given the almost identical functionality but with a different maintainership and purposeful modifications (as hinted by the description).

Although the description clarifies that 'node-yaml' is a wrapper for js-yaml (thus having a distinct technical purpose compared to the definitive 'yaml' library), the similarity in naming can still deceive users looking for 'yaml'. It is not classified as a fork since no explicit username or fork indicator is present, and it is not designed for testing purposes.

Explanation: The package '@flemist/nosleep.js' has a name that is nearly identical to the legitimate 'nosleep.js', with the only difference being the addition of the namespace '@flemist'. Such scope augmentation is a common adversarial technique intended to confuse users, even though the rest of the metadata (such as the README) is identical to the original package. The namespace does not appear to match the official maintainer or organization behind 'nosleep.js'.

Explanation: The package name 'nuxt-auth' is very similar to 'nuxt-auth-utils' by simply dropping the '-utils' suffix, which can easily mislead users. Based solely on the name, the modification appears adversarial (a common compound squatting tactic). There is no indication that nuxt-auth uses a username in its name to suggest it is a fork, and its detailed documentation and setup instructions do not indicate a distinct purpose from its legitimate counterpart.

This indicates an adversarial naming approach. Despite having a distinct purpose (using Radash methods rather than Lodash), the strong similarity in naming raises suspicion of intentional mimicry.

Explanation: The package name 'nylas-api' is constructed by prefixing 'nylas-' to the generic name 'api', which can create confusion and appears to mimic or capitalize on the legitimacy of the widely-used 'api' package. Although the edit distance is relatively high (6), the prefix augmentation is enough to deceive users. The description of 'nylas-api' as a vague 'security holding package' with minimal README information raises suspicion, especially when contrasted with the detailed and clearly defined description of the legitimate 'api' package. In addition, the absence of known maintainers further supports the interpretation that 'nylas-api' might be an intentionally mimicked fork with suspicious intent.

npm,passport-linkedin-oauth2-raviga,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [passport-linkedin-oauth2]

Explanation: The package name 'passport-linkedin-oauth2-raviga' is a clear suffix augmentation of the legitimate 'passport-linkedin-oauth2', with a moderate edit distance of 7 which suggests an intentional mimic. Based solely on the name, this qualifies as an adversarial name. Additionally, the metadata indicates that it is a patched version (i.e. a fork) of the original with enhanced security features and extended profile support. However, since the changes are enhancements rather than a distinct purpose, it does not have a distinct purpose separate from the original. The package does not appear to be a test package and is maintained by a username ('bajjuri6') that does not correspond to known maintainers of the legitimate package. Overall, while it is clearly a fork with an adversarial name, there is no evidence of malicious intent in its description. Risk level: Medium).",,,passport-linkedin-oauth2

Explanation: @types/path-parse is a scoped package that adds a namespace to the legitimate package path-parse, which could confuse users. The '@types/' namespace is commonly used for type definitions in TypeScript, indicating it is not a direct fork but rather a specific purpose package. However, the similarity in names and the potential for user confusion classify it as an adversarial name.

Explanation: 'pear-api' is an adversarial name due to the prefix 'pear-' added to 'api', which could confuse users. It appears to be a fork of 'api' as it supplies an API base for the Pear API, indicating a specific purpose distinct from the legitimate 'api'.

Explanation: The package name 'perf-ai-form-recognizer' is very similar to the legitimate '@azure/ai-form-recognizer' despite an edit distance of 6, with the only variation being the prefix 'perf' replacing '@azure'. This substitution is a common adversarial tactic (using a prefix alteration that may mislead users into thinking it is related to the official package), and the description indicating 'security holding package' further raises suspicion.

Explanation: The package 'pidl-react' uses a prefix augmentation (‘pidl-’) relative to 'react', which is a common adversarial tactic. Although its edit distance of 5 suggests a noticeable difference, the naming strategy can still easily confuse users, especially as it closely mimics the well-known 'react'. Additionally, the description 'security holding package' is suspicious and further indicates deceptive intent.

Explanation: The package name 'prefixed-api-key' closely mimics '@medusajs/api-key' by modifying the name with a prefix that can easily confuse users, fulfilling adversarial name criteria. In addition, the package appears to be a fork of the legitimate package rather than a distinct project, since it offers similar functionality while adopting a confusing naming strategy. The description, although focused on seam-style API keys, does not provide enough separation from the intent of the legitimate package and adds to the suspicious intent. The sole maintainer ('seveibar') does not match known medusajs maintainers, further contributing to the concern.

Explanation: The package name 'proc-bot-api' appears to build on 'api' by adding a prefix ('proc-bot-'), which is a classic case of prefix augmentation and mimicking. Even though the edit distance is high (9), the method of prefixing suggests an adversarial attempt to confuse users. The provided description (""Security holding package"") raises further suspicion, indicating potential malicious intent rather than a benign fork. While the naming might hint it is a fork, its lack of clear differentiation in purpose and the suspicious description suggest that it is intended to deceive users despite the high edit distance.

Explanation: The package '@lerna/publish' uses a namespace '@lerna' that mimics the legitimate 'lerna' package name. While the edit distance is high (9), the namespace usage combined with a nearly identical description to the official lerna package makes it appear as an intentional, though fork‐styled, mimic. In addition, the naming pattern (adding a suffix '/publish') is a form of scope confusion or augmentation, and the overall metadata is almost identical to that of 'lerna'.

Explanation: The package name 'puppeteer-example' is constructed by appending a common suffix to the legitimate package name 'puppeteer', which can confuse users as a mimic. The edit distance of 8 is primarily due to the added '-example' suffix. Its naming pattern (using example) suggests it is a fork or an experimental package, yet its description as a 'security holding package' is suspicious. The lack of known maintainers adds to the concern.

Furthermore, the overall description and structure of the README strongly resemble that of 'escape-html', making it appear as an uncredited fork rather than a distinct project.

Explanation: The name 'raect' is only one edit away from 'react' and employs a simple character transposition, which is a common adversarial tactic. Its description mimics React's purpose, but intentionally introduces a twisted tone and phrasing that implies it is a fork rather than a legitimately distinct project.

Explanation: Although 'rc-upload-sdk' and 'gasp-sdk' share a common '-sdk' suffix, the remainder of the name is markedly different so there is not a close letter-to-letter mimic that would trigger an adversarial name flag. However, based solely on the provided instructions and the metadata, 'rc-upload-sdk' is labeled as an obvious fork of 'gasp-sdk' and its description (claiming to be a security holding package) introduces a suspicious element to its intent. There is no namespace to further legitimize it, and the lack of known maintainers adds to the concern.

Explanation: The package name '@oakjs/react' adds a namespace to the well-known name 'react', which can mislead users to confuse it with the legitimate React library.

Explanation: The package '@types/react-devtools-inline' is very similar to the legitimate 'react-devtools-inline' by simply adding the '@types' scope, which can mimic or impersonate the original package. This is a typical pattern seen in intentional typosquatting attempts, particularly since '@types' packages are usually reserved for type definitions and may confuse users expecting the original package. The metadata provided (description rendered as [object Object]) suggests a lack of proper documentation or a possible placeholder, which increases suspicion, and the package appears to be a fork given the naming. Additionally, the maintainers being just ['types'] does not inspire confidence as from the original legitimate package.

npm,react-i18n-lite,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [preact-i18n]

Explanation: The package name react-i18n-lite is very similar to preact-i18n in that it only modifies the prefix (react vs preact) and adds a ‘lite’ suffix, which can easily be misinterpreted by users. Based solely on name, it uses adversarial tactics such as prefix alteration to mimic the legitimate package. Its functionality appears to target a similar domain (internationalization) for a related but different framework (React) while still closely mirroring preact-i18n’s concept, making it appear as an obvious fork rather than an independent, distinct project. Additionally, the similarity in the README (almost identical description style) strengthens suspicions of deceptive intent. The maintainers listed do not appear to be widely recognized with respect to the established preact-i18n project, adding to the concern.

Explanation: react-image-loader2 closely resembles the legitimate react-image by using a common prefix and a numeric suffix modification, which can deceive users. Although its description indicates a similar functionality with a build status and usage instructions, the alteration in the package name (adding '-loader2') appears to be an adversarial tweak rather than a clear fork, and there is no clear indication that it is only a testing or fork package. Additionally, the known maintainer further reduces the chance of it being simply a fork.

npm,react-modal,@acrool,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [react-modal]

Explanation: The package name @acrool/react-modal closely mimics the legitimate react-modal package via the addition of the @acrool namespace, which can be confusing for users. Although the edit distance of 8 is relatively high, the fact that it appends a namespace that does not match the origin of react-modal, along with a description that diverges (e.g. referring to toast messages and modal functionalities ambiguously), indicates potential typosquatting. Moreover, the package appears to be a fork (as evidenced by its naming and different maintainer) rather than a distinct new tool. Therefore, based solely on the provided name and metadata, the package is marked as an adversarial name with suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,react-modal

Explanation: The package name 'react-native-alert-notification' mimics 'react-native-notifications' with only a minor modification (the addition of the word 'alert') and an edit distance of 7. Based solely on the name, the alteration appears to be a 1-step semantic substitution intended to create confusion. There is no indication that the name includes an explicit username suggesting a fork, and its purpose (handling notifications) does not appear distinct from the legitimate package. The maintainer ('codingbyjerez') does not match the known maintainers of the legitimate package, and while the package description is not overtly malicious, its layout and presentation mirror the legitimate package's style, which increases suspicion.

Explanation: The name 'react-native-calendars-enhanced' is nearly identical to the legitimate 'react-native-calendars' with only a suffix added, which fits a common adversarial naming pattern (compound squatting or suffix augmentation) that might deceive users. The package description focuses on additional features rather than indicating it is a fork or test package, and although the maintainers appear to be legitimate figures, the close similarity in naming raises suspicion despite the enhancements.

Explanation: The package name 'react-native-remote-svg' is highly similar to 'react-native-svg' with the addition of the prefix 'remote', which is a known pattern in adversarial naming (prefix augmentation). Although the description suggests it aims to provide slightly different functionality (support for both svg and png via an Image component) rather than a straight fork, the naming is deceptive enough to potentially confuse users.

npm,react-native-typing-animation-effect,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [react-native-typing-animation]

Explanation: The package name 'react-native-typing-animation-effect' is a suffix-augmented version of 'react-native-typing-animation' with an edit distance of 7. This minimal modification, achieved by appending '-effect', falls into the category of adversarial name tactics (i.e. prefix/suffix augmentation) intended to confuse users. The similarity of the name and almost identical functionality as described in the README make it an obvious fork of the original, not a distinct project with independent functionality. The provided maintainer (krishna4157) does not indicate a well-known or established group behind the original package, and while the description largely mirrors the legitimate package (indicating similar purpose rather than malicious intent), the deliberate name mimicry makes it adversarial.

npm,react-native-woocoin,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [react-native]

Explanation: The package name 'react-native-woocoin' is created by appending a distinct suffix to the legitimate package name 'react-native'. This type of prefix/suffix augmentation is a known tactic for adversarial naming, even if it might indicate an extension or fork. Its minimal name modification creates potential for user confusion. There is no clear indication that it is an explicit fork or serves a distinct purpose as its description only repeats the package name, and the maintainer 'woomedya' does not clearly align with the original project, contributing to overall suspicion.Package is adversarial and have similar purpose, so it's likely a typosquat.",,,react-native

Its scope (@acrool) does not belong to the original package and appears to mimic the legitimate package’s naming. The edit distance, though moderate (8), combined with the similar high-level goal and almost identical functionality (as inferred from the brief descriptions), indicates that it is effectively a fork and likely an adversarial mimic.

Explanation: The package '@byungi/react-router-prompt' uses a namespace that is not present in the legitimate 'react-router-prompt' package, creating potential for user confusion. The name similarity (only a namespaced prefix difference) fits patterns of adversarial naming. There is no explicit indication that it is a fork (i.e. no visible markers or explicit fork messaging in its description), and its purpose is not clearly distinct as it mimics the original package’s metadata and usage instructions.

Although the namespace belongs to an individual user (fengkx), its similarity to the legitimate package name and the nearly identical description are strong indicators of intentional mimicry. The presence of a scoped username suggests that it is being presented as a fork, rather than a completely distinct package, and the high similarity in metadata supports suspicions of typosquatting.

Explanation: The package name 'redux-url' is extremely similar to 'redis-url' (edit distance of 2) and uses a single-character substitution that may confuse users. This qualifies as an adversarial name based solely on its similarity. Nonetheless, the two packages serve very different purposes—'redux-url' is a middleware for synchronizing Redux store state with the browser URL, whereas 'redis-url' is designed to connect to a Redis database. There is no indication that 'redux-url' is a fork (it does not include a username in a confusing manner) nor is it a test package, and its README and metadata are sufficiently detailed. Additionally, while the maintainers of 'redux-url' are not clearly linked to the maintainers of 'redis-url', the distinct functionality reduces the likelihood of a malicious typosquat, though the name similarity itself remains potentially deceptive.

Explanation: The package name 'reedux' is only a one-character modification from 'redux', which is enough to confuse users and mimic the original. Based solely on the name, it qualifies as an adversarial name because of the minimal change (1-step Levenshtein distance) and potential for mimicry. While the description outlines a similar concept (dealing with Redux store paths and reducers), it does not offer a clearly distinct functionality from the core 'redux'. Additionally, the package appears to be a fork (given the resemblance and minimal differences) and its renaming seems intended to leverage the popularity of 'redux'.

Explanation: The package name 'rest-fs' is very similar to 'then-fs' (edit distance of 4), suggesting it may be intentionally mimicking the legitimate package. The similar naming pattern, coupled with an almost identical high-level functionality in the descriptions, indicates potential adversarial intent. The naming pattern and lack of a clearly distinct purpose (both deal with filesystem operations) further support the idea that 'rest-fs' is an obvious fork of 'then-fs'.

Explanation: @types/safe-regex-test is a scoped package that suggests it is related to types, which is common for TypeScript definitions. However, the addition of the @types/ namespace could confuse users into thinking it is an official type definition for the safe-regex-test package. The maintainers are known in the npm community, which adds legitimacy, but the potential for confusion remains high due to the similarity in names and the common usage of the @types/ namespace.",,,safe-regex-test
npm,saludtools-ui,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@medusajs/ui]

Explanation: The package 'saludtools-ui' has no README data, which is abnormal and makes it difficult to determine its purpose. The name 'saludtools-ui' does not closely resemble '@medusajs/ui', but the lack of information and the presence of a namespace that does not clearly relate to a known organization or user makes it suspicious.

Explanation: The package name 'sanitize' is only one edit away from 'sanitizer', which makes it highly likely to cause user confusion. Based solely on the name similarity, it qualifies as an adversarial name. There is no indication in the package name (such as an explicit user or organization scope) that it is a fork, and the functionalities described closely parallel that of the legitimate 'sanitizer' package, offering no distinct purpose. Additionally, the overall presentation resembles that of the legitimate package without clear unique value, and the maintainers are not widely recognized as belonging to the original project. Taken together, these factors point towards a suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,sanitizer
npm,sap-accept,,malware,"Possible package confusion of [@sap/approuter]

Explanation: The package 'sap-accept' is labeled as a 'security holding package', which is often used to prevent typosquatting.

Explanation: The package name 'sapporo' is highly similar to 'sapper' with an edit distance of 2, which makes it easy to be confused with the legitimate package. Based solely on the name, 'sapporo' can be viewed as an adversarial mimic. Its naming and lack of a proper README (README:ERROR: No README data found!) raise concerns about its intent. In addition, the indication that it is a fork of 'sapper' without any distinct purpose further supports the suspicion of typosquatting.

Explanation: The package name 'scolengo-api' is derived from the generic name 'api' by adding a prefix, which constitutes a common tactic of compound squatting. This 1-step prefix augmentation is considered an adversarial naming tactic because it can confuse users looking for the legitimate 'api' package. The description, 'Unofficial API client of Skolengo', indicates it is trying to piggyback off the reputable 'api' package while not belonging to the same organization. Moreover, the fact that the maintainer (maelgangloff) does not match the known maintainers of the 'api' package further reinforces its classification as a typosquat/fork. Consequently, while it is a fork mimicking the legitimate package, it does not offer a distinct purpose and shows suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,api

Explanation: The package '@blockv/sdk' is very similar in name to the legitimate '@blocto/sdk', differing by a minor character change that could easily deceive users. Such an adversarial naming technique is indicative of typosquatting.

Explanation: The package name 'secretai' is similar to 'secretjs' with a 1-step Levenshtein distance, indicating it could be an intentional mimic. The purpose of 'secretai' is distinct as it focuses on AI models, while 'secretjs' is for the Secret Network SDK.

npm,security-admin,,malware,"Possible package confusion of [admin]

Explanation: The package name 'security-admin' is constructed by prefixing 'admin' with 'security-', which qualifies as a prefix augmentation—a known method for adversarial naming—even though the calculated edit distance is high. This naming approach can mislead users into confusing it with the legitimate 'admin' package. Moreover, the description 'security holding package' is suspicious and does not align with the detailed functionality provided by 'admin', raising further concerns about deceptive intent. Finally, the absence of known maintainers contributes to the overall suspicion, making this package likely a typosquat with malicious intent rather than an obvious fork or a package with a distinct purpose.

npm,sentry-cli,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [@sentry/cli]

Explanation: The package names 'sentry-cli' and '@sentry/cli' are extremely similar with an edit distance of 2, making it easy to confuse users. The lack of a namespace in sentry-cli in contrast to the legitimate scoped package suggests an attempt at scope confusion. Although one might expect a fork if there were clear signs of divergence, the description of sentry-cli clearly states that it is not the intended package and directs users to '@sentry/cli', which undermines the typical characteristics of a legitimate fork with distinct purpose. Additionally, the maintained listed for sentry-cli does not align with the known maintainers of the official Sentry package, further reducing its credibility. The description is deliberately confusing and reserved, which contributes to the assessment that the package exhibits suspicious intent. Therefore, based solely on its name and metadata, sentry-cli is considered adversarial and suspicious despite not constituting a proper fork. Risk level: High).",,,@sentry/cli

Explanation: The package name '@rsnuxt/server' is very similar to the legitimate '@nuxt/server' (edit distance 2) and uses a namespace that appears to mimic the known organization, fitting several adversarial name patterns such as a 1-step modification and prefix augmentation. Although the name might be interpreted as a fork by its similarity, it does not include a username or clear fork indicator, so it is not classified as a fork. Additionally, there is no evidence that '@rsnuxt/server' has a distinct purpose or is meant for testing. The known maintainer ('vincent.bian') supports legitimacy in terms of maintenance; however, the intentional mimicry in the package name and the suspicious overall naming pattern lead to the classification of adversarial and suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,@nuxt/server

npm,serverless-offline,@conio,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [serverless-offline]

Explanation: The package '@conio/serverless-offline' uses a namespace added to an otherwise identical package name, which is likely meant to mimic 'serverless-offline'. The edit distance of 7 combined with the prefix '@conio/' creates potential for scope confusion, making it adversarial. The package appears to be a fork rather than an independent project, since it is under the '@conio' namespace and the descriptions are almost identical. There is no indication that it serves a distinct purpose or is meant for testing. Moreover, the maintainers differ from the known maintainers of 'serverless-offline', and the metadata (README, badges, etc.) closely mirrors the legitimate package, which further supports suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,serverless-offline

Explanation: The package '@conio/serverless-plugin-ifelse' closely mimics the legitimate 'serverless-plugin-ifelse' with only a namespace addition. Despite the namespace indicating an organizational account (@conio), the name and identical description make it highly likely that the package is an intentional mimic and a fork with no distinct purpose, thereby exhibiting suspicious intent. Additionally, the edit distance is low enough and the use of a namespace that differs slightly adds to the confusion, triggering flags for adversarial naming and typosquatting.

Explanation: The package name '@vues3/shared' is extremely similar to '@vueuse/shared' (edit distance 2), which suggests an intentional mimic. Its namespace appears to imitate the legitimate organization, leading to potential confusion. Additionally, though its maintainers include a single user 'jbruwes', there is no evidence they belong to the legitimate team behind '@vueuse/shared'. The name similarity alone qualifies it as adversarial. The naming style also implies that it is a fork rather than serving a distinct purpose, and the deliberate mimicry in the name and metadata suggests suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,@vueuse/shared

Explanation: The package 'shared-ini-file-loader' lacks a namespace, while '@smithy/shared-ini-file-loader' has a specific namespace indicating it is part of the Smithy project.

npm,shell,@mfel,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [shell]

Explanation: The package '@mfel/shell' uses a namespace that deviates from the non-namespaced legitimate 'shell', which can be confusing to users. While the edit distance of 6 may seem moderate, the addition of the '@mfel' scope creates potential for deceptive mimicry. Per the instructions, the presence of a namespace differing from the original indicates it is likely a fork rather than an entirely distinct package. The package does not seem to have a distinct purpose, nor is it marked as a test package, and its maintainer ('satyamyadav') is not known to be associated with the legitimate 'shell'. The lack of README data is noted but does not, by itself, imply malicious intent. Overall, the name similarity and scope usage suggest an adversarial name and fork of 'shell', but there is not enough evidence of malicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,shell

Explanation: The name 'tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs-tic' modifies the legitimate package name 'tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs' with a suffix ('-tic') that is a minor alteration and is likely to deceive users. The edit distance is small and fits characteristics such as suffix augmentation, which qualifies it as an adversarial name.

Explanation: The package name 'text-preview' mimics the structure of 'jest-preview' by retaining the '-preview' suffix while changing the prefix in a way that could confuse users. This pattern aligns with adversarial naming techniques such as prefix substitution. While there is insufficient description metadata (no README) and no explicit indication that it is a fork, the similarity in naming combined with an abnormal description (and thus lack of clarifying information) increases the suspicion that this may be an intentional mimic.

Explanation: The package name 'totalum-api-sdk' closely mimics the structure of 'twitter-api-sdk' (both follow the pattern of <name>-api-sdk), which might confuse users. Even though the edit distance is 6, the similarity in naming and structure qualifies as an adversarial name based solely on the name. There is no indication that it is simply a fork since the name does not include a user identifier nor does it indicate a derivative work aligned with the legitimate package. Despite the fact that the package description explains its own API wrapper purpose (for Totalum's API), its naming may mislead users expecting Twitter-related functionality.

Explanation: The package name 'ts-glitter' is similar to 'ts-pattern' due to transformation that could mislead users, even with an edit distance of 4. The adversarial transformation (changing 'pattern' to 'glitter') could confuse users expecting a pattern matching library despite serving a completely different purpose (a cross‐platform hybrid framework). There is no evidence that 'ts-glitter' is a fork (its purpose and description are distinct) or a test package.

npm,ts-json-schema-generator,@tailjs,false_positive,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [ts-json-schema-generator]

Explanation: The package '@tailjs/ts-json-schema-generator' adds a scope '@tailjs' to the legitimate package name 'ts-json-schema-generator', resulting in a similar string with an edit distance of 8. This represents a scope addition that can confuse users (i.e., scope confusion) and mimic an official package. The absence of a README heightens suspicion. Although it might appear as a fork because of the namespace, it does not follow the typical fork naming (i.e., including an obvious username), and the namespace seems adversarial rather than a true organizational qualifier.

npm,ts-node-g,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [ts-node]

Explanation: The package name 'ts-node-g' is highly similar to 'ts-node' with only a minor augmentation which can easily deceive users. The suffix '-g' appears to be an adversarial modification intended to mimic the legitimate package. The information indicates that 'ts-node-g' is presented as a fork of 'ts-node' but does not demonstrate a distinct purpose; its description mimics the original albeit with spelling errors (‘globaly’). The lack of a README further increases suspicion. The sole maintainer, 'procapyt', does not match any known maintainer of the legitimate package, adding to the likelihood that this is a typosquat package with potentially malicious intent.

npm,ts-patch-mongoos,,malware,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [ts-patch]

Explanation: The package name 'ts-patch-mongoos' is created by appending a suffix to the legitimate 'ts-patch', which is a common typosquatting technique. Despite an edit distance of 8, the suffix augmentation can confuse users since it mimics the original name. Furthermore, the package description indicates it is a ""security holding package"" rather than a legitimate fork or a clearly distinct project. The lack of known maintainers further supports suspicion. Therefore, based solely on the package name and metadata, this package is classified as an adversarial name with suspicious intent and is considered an obvious fork rather than a package with a distinct purpose or a test package.

Explanation: ts-patch-mongose shares the base 'ts-patch' but appends an extra component that appears to mimic the legitimate package. The edit distance is high but the suffix augmentation follows a compound squatting pattern. Additionally, the description 'security holding package' is suspicious and distinctly different from the detailed functionality of ts-patch. There is no indication of legitimate maintainers.

Its edit distance of 7 and the intentional mimicry indicate an adversarial naming strategy. Additionally, the description 'security holding package' adds a layer of suspicious intent, and the fact that no known maintainers are associated further raises concerns. This combination of factors leads to the conclusion that ts-patch-moongoose is likely a fork intended to deceive users rather than serving a distinct purpose.

Explanation: The unscoped package name 'tween.js' is almost identical to the legitimate scoped package '@tweenjs/tween.js' in both its naming and descriptive content. Dropping the official scope can easily mislead users into thinking it is the official release, which is an adversarial naming tactic (a known example of scope confusion/impersonation squatting). Although the package metadata is largely similar, the fact that 'tween.js' loses the official '@tweenjs' namespace makes it suspicious and renders it a potential typosquat.

The edit distance of 8 combined with the namespace addition makes it likely to deceive users, and the namespace does not clearly match a known organization since the maintainer ('nielskuhnel') is not known to be associated with a legitimate update of util.

Explanation: The package '@types/util.promisify' is an intentional mimic of 'util.promisify' due to the addition of the '@types/' namespace, which is commonly used for type definitions in TypeScript. This creates potential confusion for users. The maintainers are known in the npm community, which reduces suspicion, but the namespace change and similarity in names suggest it could be adversarial.

Explanation: The package name '@duplojs/utils' is nearly identical to the legitimate 'utils', with only the addition of the organizational scope '@duplojs'. This minor modification (scope addition) can be deceptive for users and falls under adversarial naming due to scope confusion and asemantic substitution. There is no indication based on the package name that it is a fork (no obvious username suffix or fork indicator) or that it serves a distinct purpose when compared to 'utils'. Additionally, the description is minimal and largely consists of badges and a header, which neither clarifies unique functionality nor mitigates the potential for user deception.

Explanation: The package '@gnyio/utils' is nearly identical to the legitimate 'Utils' in its naming, differing only by the namespace. This small modification can be confusing to users given that the legitimate package is known simply as 'Utils'. The '@gnyio' scope does not clearly match the organizational or author identity of the legit package, making it appear as if it might be an attempt to mimic the original. Furthermore, the lack of a README adds to the suspicion. There is no evidence from the name that this is a fork (i.e. no clear username indication) nor that it has a distinct purpose.

Explanation: The package '@ariswap/v2-core' has an edit distance of 3 from '@uniswap/v3-core' and the namespace appears to mimic the well‐known Uniswap branding by substituting only one character. This, along with clear similarities in naming structure and documentation mimicking Uniswap's core contracts, suggests that it is likely an intentional fork intended to cause confusion. In addition, there is no indication that the maintainers are established or that the purpose is distinct enough from the original.

Explanation: The package name '@ariswap/v3-core' has only a minor edit distance (2) compared to '@uniswap/v3-core', indicating an intentional mimicry. Its namespace '@ariswap' appears designed to parallel the well‐known '@uniswap' organization, and the package content closely follows that of the legitimate package. Furthermore, it appears to be a fork rather than an independent project, sharing almost identical metadata and structure.

npm,vue,@voerkai18n,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [vue-i18n]

Explanation: The package '@voerkai18n/vue' is packaged under a scoped namespace that morphs the name in a way that mimics the well‐known 'vue-i18n'. The similarity in naming (using parts of the legitimate name rearranged or slightly modified) suggests an attempt to capitalize on recognition. The namespace, which appears as if it might represent an organization but differs from the legitimate package’s unscoped name, further contributes to possible user confusion. While the package appears to be a fork (as implied by the naming convention with the scope), its similarity to the well‐established 'vue-i18n' coupled with minimal unique description (“VoerkaI18n for Vue 3” vs “Internationalization plugin for Vue.js”) indicates potential deceptive intent.

Explanation: The package '@rsnuxt/vue-app' is only two edits away from the legitimate '@nuxt/vue-app', and its namespace adds an extra prefix ('rs') that appears designed to mimic the original name, leading to potential confusion. This close similarity in name (adversarial name) suggests intentional mimicry. Additionally, while the name indicates a fork of the original, there is no indication that the package serves a distinct purpose and the minimal metadata further increases the likelihood of deceptive intent.

Explanation: The package name 'vue-dia' preserves the core 'vue' prefix and adds a suffix that only slightly alters it (edit distance of 4), which falls into a pattern of compound squatting with potential for user confusion. While there is no explicit namespace conflict, the similarity in naming combined with the absence of a README (a key piece of descriptive metadata) and the lack of recognized maintainers make it suspicious.

Explanation: The package '@rsnuxt/vue-renderer' differs only slightly from the legitimate '@nuxt/vue-renderer' (edit distance of 2) with a modified namespace that mimics the original scope. This intentional modification creates confusion regarding the origin of the package. The lack of a detailed README and metadata adds to its suspicious nature, and the provided maintainer does not match the known maintainers of the legitimate package.

Explanation: The package name 'webpack-5-chain' differs only minimally from 'webpack-chain' (edit distance of 2), with a simple augmentation that could confuse users. This qualifies as an adversarial name by adding a prefix/suffix component. Additionally, despite appearing to be a fork (given the name similarity and lack of distinct purpose), its description is almost identical to the legitimate package, thereby indicating suspicious intent.

npm,webtranslateit-cli,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@transifex/cli]

Explanation: The package name 'webtranslateit-cli' bears a deceptive similarity to '@transifex/cli' by mimicking the key 'trans' component with 'translateit' and the common suffix 'cli'. Although the edit distance of 9 might seem high numerically, the structural similarity (common suffix, similar thematic context in i18n and translation) makes it potentially confusing. The name appears to be a fork rather than an entirely different project. Additionally, the description and minimal branding elements (ASCII art) provide little differentiation, which combined with the non-affiliation of the maintainer (gusbueno) compared to the recognized Transifex organization creates a suspicious picture.

Explanation: The package name 'weex-dev' is highly similar to 'save-dev' (despite an edit distance of 4) and follows a pattern that could mimic the legitimate package, making it an adversarial name. The instructions indicate that such a similarity should be flagged as not obvious non-typosquat. Furthermore, the metadata shows no README and a description that contains no clarifying details, which is especially concerning given that 'save-dev' is a security holding package. The provided guidance also suggests that this similarity implies a fork rather than a different purpose, with no indication that the package is intended for testing. Lastly, the maintainer ('superhotuser12') does not match a known maintainer in the npm community, increasing the suspicion of typosquatting. Risk level: High).",2025-02-26 08:26:56.766,,save-dev

The 'whitebit-dev' package provides only a curt description ('security holding package') that is starkly different from the detailed and specific purpose of 'mqlight-dev'. With no clearly established maintainer and with a description that appears to be designed to mislead or conceal functionality, there is reason to suspect malicious intent.

Explanation: The package name 'wix-events-backend' shares important components (i.e. the ‘wix’ prefix and ‘events’) with the legitimate '@wix/events_orders' and despite an edit distance of 9, it could confuse users who expect an official Wix product. The change in suffix from '_orders' to '-backend' is a form of delimiter and semantic substitution that may intentionally mimic the official package. There is no evidence (such as an explicit username in the package name) to indicate that this is a fork, and its metadata (description labeled as a 'security holding package' with a bare README) is suspicious. Combined with maintainers listed as ['npm'], which deviate from what one might expect for an official Wix package, these factors lead to a conclusion of an adversarial naming with suspicious intent.

Explanation: The package name 'wwact' is only two edit operations away from 'react' (with substitution of the first two letters), making it appear intentionally similar and potentially confusing. Based solely on the package name, it qualifies as an adversarial name. There is no indication that it is a fork (no username or explicit fork marker) nor that it has a distinct purpose separate from 'react'. Its description simply provides a deprecation/renaming notice (pointing users to a new package 'lithent') rather than using language suggestive of malicious intent. While its sole maintainer (""kimjinwoo"") is not recognized as a known maintainer in the npm ecosystem for React, this alone does not outweigh the name-based similarity.

Explanation: The name 'wzhuan-utils' is formed by simple prefix augmentation of the common package name 'utils', which can easily confuse users. The edit distance is 7, indicating only a minor modification, and the prefix 'wzhuan' might be interpreted as a user/organization name, but it mimics the original name closely. There is no README data in wzhuan-utils and the maintainer is just a single username, which further raises suspicion.

Explanation: Although the edit distance between 'x-adapter' and 'zustand-x' is 8, the manipulation of the naming sequence (moving 'x' from suffix to prefix and replacing 'zustand' with 'adapter') is a form of sequence reordering and asemantic substitution that can easily confuse users. The provided instructions already assert that x-adapter is considered a fork of zustand-x. Additionally, x-adapter’s description contains only a bare README without any other details, which raises suspicion about its intent.

npm,xoj,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [bfj]

Explanation: The package name 'xoj' is very similar to 'bfj' – both are three-letter names with two letters differing by substitution, which fits common typosquat patterns. There is no indication that 'xoj' is a fork (no explicit forking information or user/description stating it is related), nor does it have an obvious distinct purpose from 'bfj'. Even though its only maintainer is 'configurator' (a potentially legitimate npm user), the close similarity in name makes it potentially confusing. Thus, based solely on the name similarity, 'xoj' appears to be an adversarial name and is flagged as suspicious.Package is adversarial and have similar purpose, so it's likely a typosquat.",,,bfj
npm,xterm-addon-clipboard,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `scope confusion` package confusion of [@xterm/addon-clipboard]

Explanation: The package name 'xterm-addon-clipboard' is very similar to '@xterm/addon-clipboard' with only a minor difference (edit distance 2) that can easily confuse users. Based solely on the name, it mimics the legitimate package (adversarial name = true) and appears to be a fork given the identical high-level functionality. Though they share a common name structure, there is no clear indication of distinct purpose, and the maintainers ('hktalent') don’t appear to be established in the xterm.js ecosystem. Moreover, the odd description ('aDriv README:') in the suspicious package further raises concerns about potentially malicious intent. All these factors contribute to classifying it as a potential typosquat. Risk level: High).",2025-03-04 23:43:20.697,,@xterm/addon-clipboard

Explanation: The package 'yamoney-react-components' is labeled as a 'security holding package' and has a name that could potentially confuse users due to the inclusion of 'react-components', which is similar to the legitimate package '@remirror/react-components'. The maintainers are listed as 'npm', which is not a known individual or organization, increasing suspicion.

Explanation: The name 'yniks' is very similar to 'uniqs', differing by only two letters (u→y and q→k), which can easily be confused by users. There is no fork or clear indication of a distinct purpose, and the absence of a README further increases suspicion. The maintainers listed do not align with the legitimate package's known maintainers, contributing to the assessment of adversarial intent.Package is adversarial and have similar purpose, so it's likely a typosquat.",,,uniqs
npm,zafrul-lib,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [cspell-lib]

Explanation: The package name 'zafrul-lib' closely mimics 'cspell-lib' with a moderate edit distance, and the structure (using a '-lib' suffix) could confuse users. There is no indication that it is an official fork (no explicit username or fork indicator), and the maintainer 'zafrul75' does not appear to be affiliated with the legitimate package's community. Additionally, the lack of README data is suspicious. While there is no separate malicious description, the name similarity and missing documentation combine to suggest adversarial intent. Risk level: High).",,,cspell-lib
npm,zdog,@types,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [types]

Explanation: The package '@types/zdog' uses a common namespace '@types/' which is typically used for TypeScript type definitions. However, the legitimate package 'types' has no namespace and lacks README data, making it difficult to determine its purpose. The description of '@types/zdog' is abnormal, and the maintainers list is not informative. These factors contribute to the suspicion of '@types/zdog' being a typosquat.",,,types
npm,zenui-kit,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@nuxt/kit]

Explanation: The package name 'zenui-kit' is notably similar to '@nuxt/kit' with an edit distance of 5 and follows a pattern that could confuse users. Despite the difference in scoping (with '@nuxt/kit' having an organizational namespace), the resemblance appears intentional, making it seem like a fork of the legitimate package. The lack of a README further supports suspicion. Additionally, the only listed maintainer does not match known maintainers of '@nuxt/kit', further raising concerns about the intent behind 'zenui-kit'. Risk level: High).",,,@nuxt/kit

Explanation: The package name 'zm-cli' is highly similar to 'cp-cli' with an edit distance of 2, which indicates an intentional attempt at mimicry. The naming similarity is sufficient to deceive users, qualifying it as an adversarial name. Despite the similar high-level functionality implied by the CLI designation, there is no evidence in the name or provided metadata to suggest that 'zm-cli' serves a distinct specialized purpose, nor is it structured as a typical fork (no username included that confirms legitimate branching). The absence of a README further increases suspicion, and there is no indication that its maintainers are recognized in the community. Overall, these factors point to it having suspicious intent relative to 'cp-cli'. Risk level: High).",,,cp-cli
npm,zod,@conform-to,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of ts-to-zod - Explanation: The package '@conform-to/zod' lacks a description and has a namespace that does not clearly indicate a legitimate organization or user. The name is not a clear play on words or creative variation of 'ts-to-zod', and there is no evidence of it being a fork or having a distinct purpose. The maintainer 'edmundhung' is not recognized as a known maintainer in the npm community, increasing the suspicion of typosquatting.",,,ts-to-zod
npm,zoo-ui,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [@lion/ui]

Explanation: The package name 'zoo-ui' closely mimics the legitimate '@lion/ui' by retaining the common '-ui' suffix, while replacing 'lion' with another animal-related term 'zoo', which may confuse users expecting the official package. The adversarial nature is indicated solely by the name similarity and semantic substitution. There is no indication from the namespace or from maintainer affiliation that 'zoo-ui' is an official fork or a distinct package. Additionally, the minimal description raises further suspicion regarding its intent. Risk level: High).",,,@lion/ui
npm,zzh-layout,,anomaly,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [layout]

Explanation: The package name 'zzh-layout' is similar to 'Layout' but adds a prefix, making it potentially adversarial. The lack of a README and the error message indicate it may not serve a clear purpose, raising suspicion. However, the maintainer is known in the community, which slightly reduces the suspicion level.",,,layout
pypi,acryl-datahub-cloud,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [acryl-datahub]

Explanation: The package 'acryl-datahub-cloud' lacks a description and maintainers, which makes it suspicious. The name suggests it could be related to 'acryl-datahub' but without additional context or metadata, it is difficult to determine its purpose or legitimacy.

Explanation: AZMusicAPI has an intentionally similar naming pattern to ytmusicapi despite an edit distance of 6, leveraging case and character substitution that could confuse users. The metadata and description are almost identical in function to the legitimate package, suggesting it is a fork and not a distinct, innovative project. The adversarial construction of the name and mismatched or unrecognized maintainer (zenglk versus the known maintainers of ytmusicapi) further indicates suspicious intent.

pypi,blau,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [black]

Explanation: The package name 'blau' is highly similar to 'black' (edit distance of 2), making it a potential intentional mimic. Based solely on the name, it qualifies as an adversarial name. There is no indication of a fork (e.g., no username in the package name), nor is there evidence that 'blau' serves a distinct purpose compared to 'black'. Additionally, the absence of a clear description (or README) combined with the suspicious similarity makes its intent seem deceptive. Risk level: High).",,,black
pypi,django,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [django-dramatiq]

Explanation: The package name 'Django' is a common name for a well-known web framework, which could confuse users looking for 'django-dramatiq'.

Explanation: The package 'dlib-binary' has an identical description to 'dlib', suggesting it may not have a distinct purpose. The name 'dlib-binary' could imply a binary distribution of 'dlib', but without further context, it appears suspiciously similar. The maintainer 'Lin Xiao Hui' is not recognized as a known maintainer in the PyPI community, increasing suspicion.",,,dlib
pypi,dumbo-ml,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [dumbyaml]

Explanation: The package name 'dumbo-ml' is only 2 edits away from 'dumbyaml' and, based solely on its name, it is capable of deceiving users by mimicking the legitimate package. Despite the claim that it is obviously a fork of 'dumbyaml', there is no additional evidence in the package identifier (such as a username or clear fork indication) to override the name similarity concern. Moreover, its description is minimal ('# dumbo-ml') compared to the detailed description of 'dumbyaml', which raises suspicions of deceptive intent. Although there is one maintainer ('malvi'), this alone is not sufficient to dispel the concern given the adversarial nature of the name and the vague, uninformative description. Risk level: High).",,,dumbyaml
pypi,google-cloud-api-keys,,false_positive,This is a Google Cloud Api Keys API client library.,,,
pypi,google-requests,,stealthy package confusion,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [google]

Explanation: Although the edit distance between 'google-requests' and 'google' is high (9), the package name uses a compound squatting technique by appending '-requests', which may mislead users into associating it with the legitimate 'google' package. The name does not indicate it is a fork (no username present) and its purpose appears distinct, as seen by the minimal and vague description ('service') compared to the detailed description of 'google'. The maintainers do not match known Google maintainers. Together, these factors lead to a finding of an adversarial name with suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,google
pypi,hjson,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [orjson]

Explanation: The package name 'hjson' differs from 'orjson' by a small edit distance (2), which is a typical pattern in typosquatting attempts. Despite its description concentrating on providing a user interface for JSON (a function distinct from orjson's focus on high-performance JSON serialization/deserialization), the name similarity creates a potential for user confusion. Additionally, the description and metadata are minimal compared to the more robust description of orjson, raising suspicion about its intent. The maintainers listed do not appear to be associated with the legitimate orjson project, reinforcing the adversarial naming decision. Risk level: High).",,,orjson

Explanation: The name 'matplobblib' is very similar to 'matplotlib', with minor character changes that could confuse users. The description of 'matplobblib' is vague and does not provide a clear purpose, increasing suspicion. The maintainer 'Ackrome' is not recognized as a known maintainer in the PyPI community, and there is no indication of a distinct purpose or intentional play on words.",,,matplotlib

pypi,nopip,,false_positive,"Possible `simplification` package confusion of [pip]

Explanation: The package name 'nopip' is just a minor variation of 'pip' (edit distance of 2) and uses a prefix ('no') to mimic the original name, which is a known adversarial pattern. The similarity is intended to confuse the user into thinking it is related to pip. Additionally, its description mirrors pip’s functionality, and the fact that it caters to testing or quick scripting further blurs the line but instead supports that it is an intentional fork rather than an independent offering. The maintainer 'ronivaldo' is not recognized as part of the pip community. All these factors contribute to a conclusion of suspicious intent. Risk level: High).",,,pip

Explanation: The package names 'sagemath-categories' and 'passagemath-categories' are very similar, with 'sagemath' being a substring of 'passagemath'. The descriptions are also very similar, both referring to SageMath and its components. This suggests that 'sagemath-categories' could be a package confusion of 'passagemath-categories'.",,,passagemath-categories

Explanation: The package 'sagemath-objects' has a very similar description and purpose to 'passagemath-objects', with only a minor difference in the name. This suggests it could be a typosquat, as the names are similar enough to potentially confuse users. There is no indication of it being a fork, intentional play on words, or having a distinct purpose.

Explanation: The package name 'sites' is not very similar to 'jiter', and the purposes of the packages are distinct. However, 'sites' could be seen as an adversarial name due to its potential to confuse users, especially since it lacks a clear namespace and could mislead users into thinking it is related to 'jiter'.

pypi,syak,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [shap]

Explanation: The package name 'syak' is similar to 'shap' with a 1-step Levenshtein distance, making it potentially adversarial. The description indicates a different purpose related to syncing content with Anki, which is distinct from the machine learning model explanation of 'shap'. The maintainers are known, which reduces suspicion, but the similarity in names and the distinct purpose raises concerns about potential user confusion.",,,shap
pypi,tlsclient3,,malware,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [tls-client]

Explanation: The package name 'tlsclient3' is nearly identical to 'tls-client', differing only by removal of a hyphen and the addition of a numerical suffix, which is a classic pattern of adversarial modification. The name can easily confuse users into thinking it is an official package. The description is nearly identical to that of 'tls-client', suggesting no distinct functionality is offered and raising concerns regarding intent. Additionally, the naming pattern and metadata indicate it is effectively a fork rather than an independent package with a distinct purpose. The maintainers are not widely recognized in the community, further supporting the suspicion. Risk level: High).",2025-03-11 02:19:49.410,,tls-client
pypi,tower-cli,,false_positive,"Possible package confusion of [ansible-tower-cli]

Explanation: The package names are highly similar, with 'tower-cli' essentially missing the 'ansible-' prefix found in the legitimate 'ansible-tower-cli'. This omission represents a deliberate name transformation that could mislead users, resulting in an adversarial name even though the edit distance (due solely to the missing prefix) is 8. There is no indication from the package name or metadata that 'tower-cli' is intended as a standard fork (the name does not include a username) or a test package. Its functionality and description closely mirror that of 'ansible-tower-cli', but the maintainer ('bradhe') is not clearly associated with the official project, further raising suspicion.

pypi,zaide,,false_positive,"Possible `1-step D-L dist` package confusion of [baize]

Explanation: The package name 'zaide' is highly similar to 'baize' differing by a small substitution and slight reordering, which qualifies it as an adversarial name. There is no indication that it uses a legitimately recognized namespace or user identifier that would suggest a proper fork; however, based on the provided criteria it appears to be crafted as a fork of 'baize'. Its description ('A useless model') is starkly different from the robust description of 'baize', and does not indicate a distinct purpose. Furthermore, the minimal and deceptive metadata in 'zaide' raises suspicion of typosquatting intent. Risk level: High).",,,baize
