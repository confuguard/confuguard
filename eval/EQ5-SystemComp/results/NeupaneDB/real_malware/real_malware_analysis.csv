In addition, the instructions indicate that 'coinstrig' is obviously a fork of 'coinstring' even though its purpose is fundamentally different—a security holding package rather than a functional crypto address library—so we mark is_fork as true and has_distinct_purpose as true.

There is no indicator (such as a username prefix/suffix) that 'buffermxor' is a legitimate fork, so it is not considered a fork. Additionally, there is no indication that it serves a distinct purpose compared to 'buffer-xor' as both are intended for bitwise XOR operations on buffers. The description of 'buffermxor' as a ‘security holding package’ raises concerns about suspicious intent, suggesting it may be held to prevent abuse rather than being an authentic offering for users.

The package appears to act as a fork of 'buffer-xor' since it is using a name that intentionally mimics the legitimate package, hence is_fork is true. However, its description shows it is a security holding package, meaning its intended functionality is to reserve the package name rather than provide the bitwise-xor functionality of 'buffer-xor', so it has a distinct purpose. The package is not marked for testing purposes and its README is provided, so is_test is false and no_readme is false. Additionally, the sole maintainer 'andreeleuterio' does not represent a known maintainer in this context, and the security holding nature of the package makes its intent suspicious, so has_suspicious_intent is true and is_known_maintainer is false.

The package is not intended for testing, and the maintainer does not match known maintainers of the original package. The package provides a README, so no_readme is false.

The purpose of buffer-xov—as indicated by its description as a security holding package reserved by npm—is distinct from the functional aim of buffer-xor. Moreover, its designation as a security holding package and the lack of association with known maintainers for buffer-xor suggest that it may be intended for testing or placeholder purposes. Although it includes a README, the description is designed to deter malicious use rather than to clarify its true functionality, further contributing to its suspicious intent. Overall, these factors lead to the conclusion that buffer-xov is likely an intentional adversarial mimic rather than an obvious non-typosquat. Risk level: Low)."

The instructions indicate that buffer-xop is clearly positioned as a fork of the legitimate package (even though it is actually a security holding package), so is_fork is true.

There is no indication that it provides a distinct purpose or is intended for testing, and it has a README provided, so no_readme is false and is_test is false. There is no evidence of relocation as per known npm practices. Risk level: High)."
eslint-config-cadl,@cadl-lang/eslint-config-cadl,true_positive,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'eslint-config-cadl' is extremely similar to the legitimate '@cadl-lang/eslint-config-cadl', differing only by the removal of the organizational scope, which can easily mislead users into believing it is the official package. This type of name similarity, via scope or delimiter modification, qualifies as an adversarial name. Additionally, because it mirrors the functionality and naming of the official package, it is clearly intended as a fork rather than a distinct tool. The lack of README further raises suspicion. The provided maintainer ('hyxto9f2') does not appear to be a widely recognized or established maintainer in the community, further undermining its legitimacy. There is no evidence of a known package relocation in the npm ecosystem. Thus, all combined metrics suggest that this package is suspicious. Risk level: High)."
openapi3,@cadl-lang/openapi3,true_positive,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'openapi3' is nearly identical to '@cadl-lang/openapi3' except that it omits the recognized organizational scope, which can confuse users. This single-step change in the name qualifies as an adversarial tactic. In addition, the lack of a README and a description that does not match the detailed and purposeful messaging of the legitimate package further increases suspicion. While the stripped namespace makes it appear as if it could be a fork, there is no indication of a distinct purpose that differentiates it from the legitimate package. Lastly, the maintainer 'ef3xm6f5' is not recognized as associated with @cadl-lang, reinforcing concerns about its legitimacy. Risk level: High)."
prettier-plugin-cadl,@cadl-lang/prettier-plugin-cadl,true_positive,,,,,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"The package 'prettier-plugin-cadl' is nearly identical in name to the legitimate package '@cadl-lang/prettier-plugin-cadl' except for the omitted namespace, which makes it a clear candidate for intentional mimicry. Based solely on the name, the similarity is sufficient to deceive users (evidencing an adversarial name) and the missing namespace indicates it is acting as a fork of the original. There is no evidence of unique features or distinct functionality, so it does not have a distinct purpose. With no README data available and the description limited to 'azure package', the overall metadata is sparse and suspicious. Furthermore, the maintainers listed (['qmfpgqzu']) do not correspond to known legitimate maintainers in the community, which adds to the suspicion. Therefore, the metrics indicate that this is a typosquat/fork attempt with malicious intent. Risk level: High)."
