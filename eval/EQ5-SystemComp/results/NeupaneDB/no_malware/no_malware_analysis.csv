Based solely on the name, it qualifies as an adversarial name because the minor substitution (i.e., 'i' in place of 'o') fits well within common adversarial tactics. The provided context indicates that div-lib is a fork – its naming reflects that it is derived from dom-lib – but its generated Angular CLI scaffolding and associated instructions reveal a functionality distinct from a typical DOM helper library. Additionally, the package has a legitimate maintainer (divyanshidm) and includes a full README, reducing the risk of it being a malicious or testing-only package. There is no indication that it is relocated, and the metadata shows no suspicious intent, though the similarity in naming makes it clear that it is not an obvious non-typosquat. Risk level: Low)."

Based solely on the name, the transformation (reordering and symbol substitution) appears adversarial, triggering is_adversarial_name = true. The provided guidance explicitly classifies 'mx-appium' as obviously a fork of 'appium-xcode', so is_fork was set to true even though their purposes diverge, as seen in their descriptions (Automation for MX Apps vs. Interact with Xcode), leading to has_distinct_purpose = true. The package name and additional context indicate that 'mx-appium' is being used as a test package (is_test = true). With a single maintainer who is not recognized as a known maintainer in the npm community (is_known_maintainer = false) and a coming-soon README that lacks detail (no_readme = true), combined with a vague description that may be used to mislead, the package exhibits suspicious intent (has_suspicious_intent = true). There is no evidence that it is a relocated package (is_relocated_package = false), and due to all these factors, it is not considered obvious_not_typosquat. Risk level: Low)."

Although the functionalities are quite different (a Pokemon API wrapper vs. daemonizing Node scripts), making their purposes distinct, the similarity in naming makes it potentially confusing. The instructions indicate that 'joemon' is obviously a fork of 'daemon' despite the distinct purpose. Additionally, its maintainers are different (['dualmoon'] versus the known maintainer of daemon), and the package provides a proper README. There is no indication of testing use or malicious intent in the description, nor is it a relocated package. Risk level: Low)."

The additional 'i-' prefix, however, appears to indicate that it is a fork (as confirmed by its similar usage and functionality and the fact that it is effectively reproducing 'web-worker' with minor modifications) rather than having a distinct purpose. There are no clear indicators that it is intended for testing or that its maintainers are well-known, and the description/README is present and explains its purpose as a simpler application of web workers. Therefore, many metrics lean toward it being a fork with an adversarial naming but not overtly suspicious malicious intent. Risk level: High)."

The additional suffix signifies a distinct purpose (providing a TypeScript-first RPC library with data push capabilities), making it a fork with a specialized functionality. Although the name leverages the well-known 'typescript' term, it does not use minor modifications or deceptive alterations that would qualify as an adversarial name. The package description is detailed and matches its specialized functionality, and a README is present. Additionally, the maintainer 'vasyas' is not recognized as a known maintainer for the legitimate package, but this does not indicate typosquatting. Therefore, based solely on the package name and provided metadata, it is considered an obvious non-typosquat with a distinct and forked purpose. Risk level: Low)."

Based solely on the names, the similarity is sufficient to potentially deceive users, making it an adversarial name. The name implies it is a fork of 'global' rather than serving a distinct or clearly different purpose; nothing in the metadata indicates new or unique functionality. The description is minimal (no README data) and adds to the suspicion. Additionally, the provided maintainer ('elgubenis') is not recognized as a known legitimate maintainer within the npm ecosystem. The combination of these factors leads to the evaluation that 'global_do' is most suspicious, appearing to imitate 'global' with intent to mislead, even though it may be used as a testing or experimental fork. Risk level: Medium)."
aweb-queue,queue,true_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'aweb-queue' is very similar to 'queue' by merely adding the prefix 'aweb-', which can confuse users and is a common pattern in typosquatting through prefix augmentation. Based solely on the name, we flag it as an adversarial name. However, its description shows it is a custom implementation of an asynchronous queue module rather than serving a distinct purpose apart from 'queue', and its design and functionality are clearly modeled as a fork. The maintainer ('lijiancheng') does not match a well‐known maintainer for the legitimate package, and the package includes a proper README. There is no evidence of test-only design or relocation. Thus, while the naming is adversarial, the package is clearly marked as a fork with no additional suspicious intent. Risk level: High)."
express-eauth,express,false_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'express-eauth' is constructed by appending 'eauth' to the well‐known package name 'express', which is a typical tactic in typosquat or mimicry schemes. Based solely on the name, the similarity is sufficient to consider it adversarial and potentially confusing. However, the 'eauth' addition clearly indicates a specialized functionality (middleware for authentication), which is distinct from the core functionality of Express. The fact that the package is a fork (as indicated by its naming and different maintainers) further supports that it is an intentional offshoot rather than a mere typo. The maintainers are not the same as the original Express team, and while their identities do not directly match the legitimate package’s team, there’s no obvious malicious intent shown in the description. Moreover, the presence of a complete README indicates it is not a test or placeholder package. Overall, while the purpose is distinct, the adversarial naming technique and the fork status prevent it from being obvious_not_typosquat. Risk level: Low)."

Based solely on the package name, it qualifies as an adversarial name. The indication that ‘vue-focus-true’ is obviously a fork—with naming that mimics the legitimate one—means it does not serve a distinct purpose (furthermore, it appears tailored as a fork). Its description is minimal and unclear, raising suspicion about its intent, and it even appears to be used for testing purposes. Although the maintainer is listed as ‘wanglt’ (an individual rather than a well-known organizational account), indicating that the package might be a fork from a personal adaptation, the combination of these factors raises concerns about it being a typosquat rather than a benign fork. A README exists, so no_readme is false, and there is no indication of a package relocation. Risk level: High)."

Based solely on the name similarity, 'etx' is an adversarial name. In addition, the instructions directly indicate that 'etx' is obviously a fork of 'eta' (even though their functionalities differ: 'eta' serves as a template engine while 'etx' is an events schedule/event trigger manager, giving each a distinct purpose). 'etx' does not appear to be a test package and includes a README, and its maintainer appears to be a single developer ('tangshuang') rather than a well-known organization. There is no indication of suspicious intent in the description or metadata, nor is there relocation between the packages. Overall, while the name is clearly mimicking and thus potentially adversarial, the differences in functionality reduce suspicions of malicious intent. Risk level: Low)."

This type of transformation (semantic substitution) is a known tactic in typosquatting, hence it is marked as an adversarial name. Additionally, given the similarities and the fact that the package doesn’t offer a clearly distinct purpose, it appears to be a fork of the legitimate package, rather than a legitimately distinct implementation. The package is not indicated as a test package, has a README, and does list a maintainer ('merwan') which suggests known maintainership; however, the similarity in naming and content indicates suspicious intent. There is no evidence that the package is a relocated package. Risk level: High)."

The similarity in naming indicates an adversarial mimic, hence is_adversarial_name is true. The package is considered a fork since it appears to be derived from or closely mimics the naming of 'json2md', though it serves a distinct purpose (converting JSON into SQL queries vs. converting JSON into Markdown). The package is not a test package and it has a README, and its maintainer 'ppiyush13' is treated as a legitimate maintainer.

The similarity in names indicates potential deceptive intent, hence obvious_not_typosquat is false and has_suspicious_intent is true. However, despite the similarity, 'lil-dom' is not explicitly presented as a fork (it does not include a username prefix/suffix indicating a fork), and based on its functionality—creating DOM nodes rather than checking for them—it offers a distinct purpose relative to 'is-dom'. Its maintainership by 'dmamills' appears to be legitimate, and both packages include a README. Additionally, there is no evidence of relocation. Risk level: Low)."

The given details indicate that 'jsupload' is deliberately mimicking 'upload-js', suggesting it is effectively a fork (is_fork is true) even though there is no explicit evidence of code borrowing. Their functionalities overlap significantly with no clear distinct purpose (has_distinct_purpose is false) and there is no indication that 'jsupload' is used for testing (is_test is false). The maintainer 'centny' appears to be a recognized individual within the npm community (is_known_maintainer is true).

Based solely on the package name, the similarity is sufficient to be considered an intentional mimic (obvious_not_typosquat set to false and is_adversarial_name set to true). Moreover, because 'qjttest' is clearly derived from 'ttest' by adding an extra prefix, it appears as an obvious fork (is_fork true). Despite the name similarity, the functionality described in 'qjttest' (providing operations like sum and ride) is distinct from the statistical testing purpose of 'ttest', hence has_distinct_purpose is true. While the package description contains the word ""test"", it does not indicate that the package is meant exclusively for testing purposes, so is_test is false. The only listed maintainer ('qianjitang') does not appear to be a recognized maintainer within the npm community associated with 'ttest', leading to is_known_maintainer being false. As 'qjttest' provides a README-like description, no_readme is set to false. Given the name mimicry and similar metadata while offering different functionality than the legitimate ttest, the package shows signs of suspicious intent such as deceiving users (has_suspicious_intent true). There is no evidence that one package is a relocated version of the other (is_relocated_package false). Risk level: Low)."

The fact that 'app-actions' appears to be a fork (indicated by it being developed by a different maintainer, 'miklos.megyes') further supports the notion that it is intended for a distinct purpose rather than to confuse users. Its minimal README does not trigger suspicion of malicious intent, and there is no evidence of relocation. Risk level: Low)."
expo-mapbox,expo-pwa,false_positive,,,Yes,Obvious name difference,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,"Both package names share the common 'expo-' prefix, but the parts after the hyphen—'mapbox' vs. 'pwa'—describe very different functionalities. They are not so similar as to deceive a user into confusing one for the other, so the name is not adversarial. Following the instructions provided, expo-mapbox is explicitly treated as an obvious fork and is also noted as a test package. Furthermore, its distinct functionality (a mapping service rather than PWA resource generation) confirms a different intended purpose, and the legitimate maintainer ('tsapeta') supports the non-malicious nature. The missing README flags no_readme as true, but overall there is no evidence of deceptive intent. Risk level: Low)."

However, their purposes are clearly distinct: 'dnsjs' is focused on name resolving while 'pngjs' handles PNG encoding/decoding, so they serve different functions. The metadata indicates that 'dnsjs' is not simply a fork (its functionality is different) and the presence of a proper README and identifiable maintainers (plexrayinc) suggests legitimate development. Despite that, the similarity in naming creates a deceptive potential. Thus, obvious_not_typosquat is set to false because the name similarity renders the package suspicious, and has_suspicious_intent is true based solely on the name mimicry. Risk level: Low)."

There is no evidence that bitbucket-semver is attempting to impersonate or deceive users of semver-regex. The functionality and target use cases are distinct, and bitbucket-semver is not a fork of semver-regex but a different tool. The package is not designed for testing purposes, has a proper README, and its maintainer ('mikestead') does not match the legitimate maintainer of semver-regex.

Based solely on the name, this qualifies as an adversarial name. However, the metadata indicates that 'rs.js' is clearly a fork because its description—‘Rule Schema based object transform class’—differs markedly in intent from the Server-Sent Events focus of 'sse.js', giving it a distinct purpose. Furthermore, despite its adverse-looking name similarity, the package is not flagged as a test package and is maintained by a known maintainer ('daleoooo'), and it also includes a README.

'reactip' is designed for React tooltip components whereas 'd3-tip' is built for d3.js visualizations. This substantial difference in naming and functionality leads to an obvious_not_typosquat decision as true. Based solely on the name, similar elements do not create sufficient confusion to be deemed adversarial (thus is_adversarial_name is false). There is no indication of a fork relationship, nor does the package name include a known maintainer’s username that indicates a fork, so is_fork is false. The purposes of the packages are distinct given their specific ecosystems (has_distinct_purpose is true), and the package is not intended for testing (is_test is false). The maintainer ('huozhi') appears to be a legitimate contributor in the npm community (is_known_maintainer is true), and the package includes a detailed README (no_readme is false).

Based solely on the name, it appears to be intentionally mimicking 'infer-owner', making it an adversarial name and an obvious fork of the legitimate package. Additionally, 'owner' does not have a README while claiming to provide permission control functionality, which, combined with its suspicious naming strategy, indicates potential deceptive intent. However, the maintainer 'adamhalasz' is recognized as a legitimate contributor in the npm ecosystem, and there is no sign that the package has been relocated from 'infer-owner'. Overall, the package raises suspicion due to its naming and missing documentation, despite having a known maintainer, and does not present a distinct purpose from the legitimate package.

This similarity qualifies it as having an adversarial name, since it can lead to misattribution despite the fact that the actual functionality is completely different: 'gh-stats' gathers GitHub related statistics (stars and forks) whereas 'eslint-stats' processes ESLint error statistics. The use of a user-specific handle (shekhargulati) also implies that 'gh-stats' is a fork rather than an unaffiliated typosquat. Additionally, its distinct purpose, detailed README, and presence of a known maintainer further support that it is a fork with a unique use compared to 'eslint-stats' with no malicious or deceptive intent. There is also no evidence of relocation. Therefore, although the naming is adversarial and intentionally similar, the overall context shows it is a fork with a distinct functionality.

There is no indication that it is intended solely for testing, and the maintainer ('zhanglizhao') is not a recognized maintainer within the corresponding mainstream ecosystem. Moreover, although the description clarifies it is modified for personal use, it does not have unique functionality compared to the legitimate package.

In addition, the package has a proper README with installation and tutorial details and is maintained by a legitimate user, which lowers suspicion of malicious intent. Therefore, while the name similarity is adversarial, the overall assessment is not that 'sh' is an obvious typosquat of 'shave'. Risk level: Low)."

There is no indication that 'fibrio' is a fork (it does not include any user-specific prefix/suffix that would denote a fork of fabric) or a test package. The maintainer listed for fibrio ('ethantw') appears to be a recognized contributor in the community, and its README is present and complete. There is no sign of suspicious intent or relocation in the package metadata.

The description is detailed and not merely testing or minimal, so it isn’t considered a test package, and the maintainer (simkall) does not match the known maintainers of 'marked', which further supports it being a fork. There is also a readme present, so no_readme is false, and there is no evidence of relocation.

The similarity in their names makes 'kg' potentially confusing despite its distinct functionality. It does not exhibit typical fork characteristics (no username prefix/suffix) and isn’t a test package. The known maintainer ('stephenhandley') further supports its legitimacy in terms of development, and the presence of a proper README means no_readme is false. Nonetheless, the deceptive similarity in the package names, independent of the description, means that 'kg' has suspicious intent regarding name confusion. Risk level: Low)."

The scenario also indicates that 'fx-ejs' is obviously presented as a fork ('is_fork': true) even though its functionality is almost identical, and it does not show any distinct added value ('has_distinct_purpose': false). The name and the context also suggest that it is framed as a test package ('is_test': true). Additionally, with only one maintainer listed ('bhou') and no evidence that this individual is a known or commonly trusted maintainer in the community, we set 'is_known_maintainer' to false. Although there is a README present, so 'no_readme' is false, the overall similarity in naming and the deceptive mimicry of the legitimate package's metadata leads us to mark 'has_suspicious_intent' as true.

This naming pattern suggests it is an obvious fork with a distinct purpose rather than an adversarial mimic. The maintained identity ('neruchev') is not the official maintainer of 'typescript', resulting in is_known_maintainer as false.

However, the functionality indicated in the descriptions is different: 'styled-icons' provides a large set of icon components from various icon libraries, while 'styled-tags' focuses on custom inline tag components. This distinct functionality argues against it being a fork, and it is clearly not a test package. The maintainer 'hyogman' does not match the known maintainers of the legitimate package, so we do not consider it a known maintainer. There is a proper README, which also lowers suspicions.

There is no indication that 'archi' is a fork (its functionality is substantially different) or that it is a test package. The maintainer for 'archi' (nescalante) appears to be a legitimate npm community member, and both README and detailed documentation are present.

Additionally, ws.api is not marked as a test package, no indication of relocation exists, and its maintainer ('rmiswhere') does not match the established maintainer of nwsapi. Its detailed README indicates that it is not simply an empty or placeholder package. Hence, while the naming is suspicious, the differences in intended functionality and maintainership indicate that it is not a direct fork, but the mimicry in the name nevertheless makes it potentially deceptive.

Although both names share the common notifier suffix, the core identifier ('qunit' vs 'webpack') points to different functionalities: one is meant for QUnit-based test notifications while the other is focused on webpack build notifications. The deliberate difference indicates that qunit_notifier is not an intentional mimic, and its purpose is distinct. The package name does not qualify as adversarial since the modification isn’t a minor character change intended to deceive users. Additionally, although the name and functionality suggest it is a test-related package, and thus flagged as such, there is no evidence that qunit_notifier is a fork or a relocated package of webpack-notifier. The provided README exists and gives clear guidance, and the maintainer ('tiveron') is not a recognized maintainer from the webpack-notifier ecosystem. Overall, while qunit_notifier serves a distinct purpose (notifying results of QUnit tests) and is a test package, it does not display the characteristics of an intentional typosquat or adversarial naming.

In this instance, the evidence indicates that swaggerify is clearly intended as a fork; it does not incorporate a user name prefix/suffix to mark it as an independent or experimental package, and its maintainer (bebraw) is identified and known. Moreover, while swaggerify and swagger-inline address related tasks (handling swagger definitions), their purposes differ: swagger-inline focuses on generating an OpenAPI/Swagger definition from inline comments, while swaggerify automates the generation of metadata definitions without requiring manual entry.

Their similarity is not enough to intentionally mimic or cause confusion. There is no indication of adversarial intent based solely on the name, nor does the metadata suggest the package is a malicious fork or testing tool.

Based solely on the name, the addition of '-uml' is an example of suffix augmentation and can potentially confuse users, thus it is considered an adversarial name. However, the metadata (e.g. README, badges) clearly describes a work‐in‐progress tool and does not suggest malicious intent. It is not a fork in the sense of indicating the user (maintainer fsahmad) is forking the original project, and there is no evidence it is simply a test package or relocated package. Moreover, since the maintainer is not recognized as a known maintainer for the official TypeScript project, the package is not clearly endorsed by the community behind TypeScript.

Nonetheless, since vuexfrom seems to be a fork package (as indicated by its naming pattern that might suggest an affiliation with a project using vuex) and it serves a distinct purpose (providing form helpers for vuex in contrast to req-from’s functionality of requiring modules from a given path), it is considered a fork package with distinct functionality. There is no evidence from the naming alone that the vuexfrom name is adversarial or designed to deceive users into thinking it is req-from. Additionally, the package’s description is detailed and clearly explains its purpose, so there is no suspicious intent.

Although the functionality differs – 'build-component' is a CLI tool for creating React component boilerplates and 'component-bind' is a function binding utility – the naming pattern suggests a deliberate reordering and asemantic substitution. Furthermore, the instructions note that 'build-component' is obviously presented as a fork of 'component-bind'. With a legitimate maintainer listed as 'jrvq' but no further evidence of recognized maintainers, and with a clear README present, it scores as: not obviously not a typosquat (obvious_not_typosquat is false), adversarial based on name (is_adversarial_name true), obviously a fork (is_fork true), and having a distinct purpose (has_distinct_purpose true).

Additionally, despite the similarity in name, recastjs is not a fork of recast because it targets a different domain and does not share the same implementation. The package includes a well-developed README, and while the maintainer ('vincent__') is not the same as that of the legitimate package, there is no immediately obvious suspicious intent in the metadata.

The presence of a known maintainer ('russellw') for ayane further supports its legitimacy. With these factors combined, the name appears intentionally mimicking yet the functional differences indicate that 'ayane' is an obvious fork of 'wayang' rather than a malicious typosquat. Also, both packages include a README; there’s no evidence of suspicious intent or relocation. Therefore, we conclude with the provided assessment metrics. Risk level: Low)."

Additionally, there is no indication (e.g. username prefix/suffix or explicit fork marker) that 'carousel-slider' is simply a fork of 'angularjs-slider'. Its underlying functionality (carousel features for generic web pages) is distinct from a slider directive built for AngularJS, meaning it serves a distinct purpose. The package comes with a proper README and has identifiable legitimate maintainers (brenton-cozby), and no suspicious intent is found in its description.

However, the inclusion of 'jjj' appears to be a reference to the maintainer 'jjjake', which indicates it is intended as a fork rather than an attempt to mislead, and it replicates the functionality of bezier-js without a distinct purpose. Although it lacks a README (no_readme is true), there are no additional clues of malicious intent, and the maintainer is known in the community. There is no evidence of relocation. Overall, while the similarity makes it look adversarial, the context (fork by a known maintainer) prevents it from being flagged as a typosquat with malicious intent. Risk level: Low)."

The distinct functionality distinguishes it from the original 'money' package. Despite the lack of a README (which results in no_readme being true), there is no clear evidence of overt malicious or deceptive intent in its description.

The metadata indicates it is obviously a fork of 'sass' (with no indication of offering a distinct purpose as both share the same high-level goal), and its name construction suggests it mimics the original intentionally. The fact that it appears to be used for testing or experimental purposes (as noted in point 5) further supports classifying it as a test/fork package. Additionally, the maintainer is not recognized as a legitimate maintainer of the original 'sass', and the vague, non-descriptive README (""README:# 本木样式项目"") increases suspicion. It is not a relocated package and does include some README content. Taken together, these points lead to the metrics provided. Risk level: High)."

However, 'react-math' is clearly a fork: its maintainer ('cezary') is established in the community and the package provides a similar React component but with a distinct implementation (producing MathML rather than using MathJax) which justifies a separate purpose. Additionally, since the README and description are complete, there is no sign that this package is simply used for testing nor does it lack a README.

The inclusion of 'test' in both the name and description indicates that it is intended for testing purposes, which further implies that it is a fork version rather than a distinct package with a completely new purpose. The description largely mirrors that of the legitimate package and does not include malicious or deceptive intent. Although the maintainer is not recognized as a known maintainer in the npm community, the overall structure and presentation of the package do not suggest malicious intent, and the package includes a detailed README.

In addition, the naming pattern indicates that cli-table2 is an intentional fork of the original cli-table package which cli-table3 has since overtaken as the maintained version. There is no evidence in the name, description, or namespace that suggests a distinct purpose aside from being a fork, nor does the description hint at any testing purpose.

There is no namespace or scope confusion since both are in the npm ecosystem without additional scope, and the maintainer 'mosn' is not recognized as a known maintainer for jsonpack, so is_known_maintainer is false.

There is no clear distinct functionality indicated that separates it from 'react-map-gl', therefore it does not have a distinct purpose. It does not indicate that it is for testing purposes, and its maintainer ('apercu') appears legitimate within the npm ecosystem. However, the lack of a README (as evidenced by the error) further heightens suspicion. There is no evidence of a well-known relocation within npm.

Additionally, the name 'xhr.js' does not demonstrate adversarial modifications and it includes a readme with clear documentation. The maintainer information (['atool']) does not indicate any suspect affiliations. Thus, there is no evidence that 'xhr.js' is an intentional mimic or typosquat of 'tar-js'. Risk level: Low)."

Despite the similar format, the functionality differs as one deals with environment variable loading and the other with unzipping, which suggests a distinct intended purpose. However, question guidance explicitly states that 'cross-dotenv' is obviously a fork of 'cross-unzip'. The maintainers of 'cross-dotenv' (['studds']) are not recognized as known maintainers in the npm community for 'cross-unzip', increasing suspicion. The description, although including a README, raises concerns as it appears to be a combination of known package names (kentcdodds/cross-env with dotenv) mimicking established functionality, which further supports a suspicious intent.

However, given the provided context, qdlist is described as a quicker doubly-linked list while bplist is a binary plist parser and creator, indicating distinct functionalities. The similarity in name appears to be a deliberate fork rather than a malicious attempt to replicate the original package. The maintainer for qdlist (andrasq) isn’t associated with the known maintainer of bplist, and there is a README present for qdlist, reducing the risk of mistaken identity.

The provided description for 'whatif' indicates a focus on smarter 'if' condition handling, which is clearly a different functionality from the asynchronous/promises focus of 'when', so it has a distinct purpose. However, since its naming is confusingly similar, and the package is presented as a fork (using a different maintainer 'homy' without clear ties to the original community), it is identified as a fork-like package. There is no evidence that it is intended solely for testing, nor is it a relocated package, and the package includes a README.

In addition, the metadata shows that pouchdb-mc uses the full PouchDB description rather than the utility focus of pouchdb-json, indicating that pouchdb-mc is operating as a fork rather than serving a distinct new function. The maintainers list for pouchdb-mc contains only 'sitapati', which does not match known PouchDB maintainer profiles, and there is no sign that this is a community sanctioned fork.

The name change does not involve minor edit changes typical of typosquats, and there is no evidence of an adversarial tactic in the naming or metadata. Although the maintainer is not a widely known entity, the available readme and description indicate a functional preset rather than a deceptively imitative package.

Furthermore, the functionality implied by 'pg' (which might suggest something related to PostgreSQL) is distinct from what 'rpc' (remote procedure call) implies, so the two packages have distinct purposes. In addition, the fact that the package name includes the word 'test' makes it appear to be used for testing purposes. The maintainer 'prachig123456' is not a widely known or trusted maintainer in the npm ecosystem, and the absence of a README in the metadata does not by itself imply malicious intent.

Additionally, the name implies that it is a fork of 'copy-props' rather than an independent package, as specified. The functionality as indicated in the description (a generic welcome project without clear distinctive implementation differences) suggests that its purpose is not distinct from the original 'copy-props'. Moreover, there is an implication that this package might be used for testing purposes (or as a starter kit), and the maintainer list (['phoeon']) does not match known maintainers of the original package.

However, the functionality is completely distinct: 'docopt' is a command line option parser while 'do-copy' provides copy-to-clipboard functionality in modern browsers, indicating that 'do-copy' is a fork package with a distinct purpose. The package is not marked as a test package and its maintainers (['tw666']) do not align with known trusted maintainers of 'docopt'. The readme is present and there is no explicit malicious or suspicious intent in the description.

'base65537' is not attempting to mimic or confuse users into thinking it is 'bossy' (which handles command-line options), since it implements a completely different functionality (binary encoding). Furthermore, its description is detailed and includes a README, and its maintainer (qntm) is a recognized developer in the npm community, which further corroborates that this is an independent project rather than a fork or a deceptive typosquat.

Additionally, the naming convention and similarity indicate that js-timer is obviously a fork (or mimic) of the established d3-timer package, meaning it does not offer a distinct purpose beyond what d3-timer provides. The metadata and description do not clearly position it as a dedicated testing package, but per the provided instructions it should be considered as such.

There is no indication that ‘navit’ is a fork (it does not incorporate a username in a way that would indicate a fork) and it is indeed meant for testing purposes. The maintainer listed (‘vitaly’) does not match a known association with ‘waait’, and the package has a well-formed README, dispelling concerns of a relocated package or one lacking readme.

This similarity can be confusing (a 1-step modification resembling adversarial techniques) leading us to set is_adversarial_name true and obvious_not_typosquat false. Additionally, the information provided states that 'react-ui5' is obviously a fork of 'react-uuid' (likely indicated by the derivation in its naming) while still fulfilling a distinct purpose – implementing the SAP OpenUI5 framework rather than generating UUIDs. Although the description reveals a complete README and does not contain malicious metadata, the instructions explicitly indicate that 'react-ui5' appears to be used as a test package; hence, is_test is set true. The maintainers list (['alessh']) is treated as legitimate, so is_known_maintainer is true. There is no evidence of package relocation.

However, the functionality is clearly distinct: 'jcopy' is designed for copying objects while 'hoopy' is a circular array implementation. There is no evidence that 'jcopy' is a fork of 'hoopy' and its description and usage examples indicate a different purpose. Additionally, 'jcopy' has a proper README and its maintainer (volodymyr.sichka) is not associated with 'hoopy', so it is not considered a known maintainer of the legitimate package.

This is consistent with adversarial techniques such as sequence reordering and asemantic substitution. Moreover, given that 'wk-cli' uses a naming pattern that suggests it is a fork of 'cli-ux' (despite the latter being deprecated), and it is maintained by a different (and not widely recognized) maintainer, it reinforces the fork relationship with no clear distinct purpose. The package further raises red flags due to its absence of a README and a vague description, which contribute to the overall assessment of suspicious intent.

Its naming suggests it is essentially a fork/extension. The maintainer is not a widely recognized maintainer in the npm community, and while the scope clearly indicates an extension rather than an attempt to impersonate the original library maliciously, the similarity in name is still enough to flag it as an adversarial naming practice. The package has a detailed README, so no_readme is false. There is no indication that this package is intended for testing purposes, nor is it a relocated package.

Based solely on the name, the alteration (substitution of 'async' with 'rx') is a common adversarial tactic (one-step lexical modification), so is_adversarial_name is set to true. 3. The naming pattern suggests that eventemitter-rx is meant to be a fork (it explicitly builds on the concept of an event emitter but with an RxJS twist), therefore is_fork is true. 4. Although both packages handle event emitting, eventemitter-rx focuses on RxJS-based event handling while async-eventemitter is centered on asynchronous callbacks. This difference in implementation and usage gives eventemitter-rx a distinct purpose, so has_distinct_purpose is true. 5. There is no indication that eventemitter-rx is a testing-only package (its name or description does not imply testing), so is_test is false. 6. The maintainer 'stylelounge-it' is not recognized as an established, known maintainer for the async-eventemitter ecosystem, hence is_known_maintainer is false. 7.

The name 'memrobo' does not seem designed to deceive based solely on its composition, and no suspicious namespace anomalies are present. The maintainers list includes 'npm', which is a known entity in the npm ecosystem and does not raise flags in this context. The README is present and detailed.

Its description, however, is notably different (Chinese instructions versus a visual regression testing tool with rich documentation) which indicates a distinct purpose despite the similar CLI utility nature. The package also appears to be intended as a test or experimental CLI tool. With maintainers listed solely as ['linzikang'] and no affiliation indicated with the original package, it does not seem to be maintained by the same team.

The similarity in naming and the possibility of minor character transformation point towards it being a fork. However, because both packages originally have distinct aims (cuss maps profane words, whereas cusp describes itself as a modern web micro framework based on CSP design patterns), this should indicate a distinct purpose but instructions specify that cusp is 'obviously a fork' of cuss, so we mark is_fork as true and has_distinct_purpose as false. The package 'cusp' has no README, so no_readme is true. Despite the description of cusp aiming at a web framework—a purpose that doesn’t match the legitimate package—the conflicting metadata raises suspicion (has_suspicious_intent true) as the mimicry in the name does not align with its description.

Additionally, the guidance implies that ididi is clearly intended as a fork of didi, and indeed the similarity suggests it is mimicking the well‐known legitimate package. The descriptions diverge greatly: didi has a detailed README outlining its dependency injection functionality, while ididi’s description only says 'README:', suggesting a lack of content and raising concerns. The absence of a proper README marks no_readme as true, and the lack of descriptive content further flags suspicious intent.

Although 'defjs' has a completely different functionality (Ruby-style inheritance for JavaScript) compared to 'deeks' (deep key extraction), and thus offers a distinct purpose, the similarity in names can still confuse users. In addition, the presence of a proper README and the lack of affiliation with known maintainers of 'deeks' do not dilute the deceptive potential inherent to the naming.

This similarity makes the name adversarial. However, there is no indication from the naming style (e.g., no username prefix/suffix that explicitly marks it as a fork) that it is a fork; further, the functionalities differ: 'typedot' is positioned as an elegant type checking middleware for Express.js, while 'typeson' focuses on preserving types in JSON, BSON, or socket.io usage. This difference means that despite the name mimicry, both packages have distinct purposes. The package does not suggest it is merely for testing and includes a well-described README, so it is not flagged as a test package or as lacking documentation. Additionally, the maintainer list (‘alexarena’) is presumed legitimate. Nonetheless, the intentional similarity in naming along with aspects of its metadata (which includes a proof-of-concept notion and a cautionary disclaimer) leads to a suspicion of intent, hence the flags for adversarial name and suspicious intent.

Despite this, the package is clearly intended as a create-react-app template for building Electron applications, making its purpose distinct from the general electron-builder package. The naming also indicates that it is a fork derivative (a specialized use case) rather than an unrelated deceptive package. Its README is present, and the maintainer ('jlkp001') appears to be a legitimate maintainer in the community. There is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious description, and there is no known relocation between the packages. Risk level: Low)."
ckeditor5-build-sl,ckeditor5,true_positive,,,No,Confusing package,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'ckeditor5-build-sl' is only a minor variation of the legitimate 'ckeditor5' (a simple prefix/suffix augmentation) and closely mimics the original name, making it potentially confusing. Without additional metadata to indicate an entirely distinct purpose, it seems to be a fork rather than a separate project with clear differentiation. The addition of '-build-sl' does not signify a distinctive functionality; it remains very similar to the legitimate package, yet the maintainer does not appear to be a known or official CKEditor maintainer. The package includes a full README and detailed description, but its similarity to the legitimate package introduces suspicious intent. It is not a test package and there is no evidence of a known organizational ownership or relocation. Therefore, the metrics indicate suspicions of typosquatting. Risk level: High)."
polyline,polyline-miter-util,false_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The package 'polyline' shares a common substring with 'polyline-miter-util' but it provides a full-fledged polyline encoding/decoding implementation, whereas 'polyline-miter-util' offers low-level miter join utilities. Despite the naming similarity, the purposes of the two packages are distinct. In addition, the maintainers of 'polyline' (mapbox-admin) are well-known in the npm community and the package includes a complete README and detailed description. There are no signs of malicious intent or deliberate mimicry solely based on the name. Therefore, 'polyline' is clearly not a typosquat. Risk level: Low)."
tilebase,firebase,false_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The package name 'tilebase' and 'firebase' share only a common suffix ('base') but have clearly distinct prefixes ('tile' vs 'fire') making them not similar enough to imply intentional mimicry. Based solely on the name, there is no adversarial naming technique employed and the name is not confusing. Although the word 'base' appears in both names, the overall names are distinct and their functionalities are completely different: Firebase is a comprehensive backend service while TileBase appears to be a tool for managing MBTiles-like tile storage. The package does not indicate it is a fork (there is no user/organization name added to mimic Firebase) and the distinct purpose is clearly demonstrated in its description. There is no indication that the package is for testing purposes, and the presence of a legitimate maintainer ('ingalls') and a proper README confirms a legitimate usage. There is also no evidence of the package being relocated from Firebase. Overall, based on these factors the package is not suspicious or an obvious typosquat. Risk level: Low)."
winston-postgresql,winston-syslog,false_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"Both package names share the same prefix ('winston-') and only differ in the transport target (postgresql vs syslog), which makes them sufficiently similar to potentially confuse users. Based solely on the name, winston-postgresql could be perceived as an intentional mimic of winston-syslog (adversarial name = true). However, the package clearly indicates a different functionality (a PostgreSQL transport vs a syslog transport), which means it has a distinct purpose while still appearing as a fork (is_fork = true, has_distinct_purpose = true). There is no indication of the package being used for testing (is_test = false) nor of it being a relocated package (is_relocated_package = false). The maintainers listed (['meatballyang']) do not appear to be recognized as the standard or known maintainers for the winston ecosystem (is_known_maintainer = false) and the package includes a proper README, so no_readme is false. The description does not display suspicious intent, hence has_suspicious_intent is false. Therefore, it is not an obvious non-typosquat but does demonstrate characteristics consistent with an adversarial name intended to capitalize on the similarity to winston-syslog. Risk level: Low)."
confirm-html,html-validate,false_positive,,,Yes,Distinct purpose,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,"The two package names, 'confirm-html' and 'html-validate', are not extremely similar; they share the 'html' token but the leading component is different ('confirm' vs 'validate'), making them less likely to be confusing intentionally. Based solely on the name, there isn’t evidence of typical adversarial transformations, so 'is_adversarial_name' is marked false. However, the provided instruction indicates that 'confirm-html' is clearly a fork of 'html-validate' (a claim made in point 3), so 'is_fork' is set to true. Despite this fork relationship, the two packages serve distinct purposes – 'confirm-html' implements a simple confirm box functionality while 'html-validate' provides offline HTML validation – hence 'has_distinct_purpose' is true. The description of 'confirm-html' (“a simple confirm box run in web pages” with a minimal README) and its function to verify that a confirm box works suggest it is used for testing, so 'is_test' is marked true. The maintainer ('xiawenqi') does not appear to be among widely known npm maintainers for the original package, leading to 'is_known_maintainer' being false. Since the package provides a README, 'no_readme' is false, and there is no evidence of malicious or deceptive intent in its metadata, so 'has_suspicious_intent' is false. Finally, there is no indication that 'confirm-html' is a relocated version of 'html-validate', so 'is_relocated_package' is false. Risk level: Low)."
